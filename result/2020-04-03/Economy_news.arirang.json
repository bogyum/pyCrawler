We've gone through the Asian financial crisis, SARS and the global financial crisis, but this is something else.\"\n\nThe outbreak has also inflicted significant financial losses on the aviation fueling industry.\nThe Incheon International Airport Corporation entrusted the airport's fueling facility to a private carrier, which is now experiencing a plunge in demand for aviation fuel.\nThe company needs to pay 2.4 million U.S. dollars for monthly rent, but its sales in March were just over 800-thousand dollars.\nWhile the government said it will lower rent by 20 percent, the company says it's not enough.\n\n\"The demand for aviation fuel plummeted following the shutdown of many flights, but we are increasingly burdened as our inventory piles up. Our sales have dropped by over 70 percent.\"\n\nThe unanticipated and unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has sent the aviation industry into a tailspin, and the ripple effects are equally painful for the third-party contractors that work hand-in-hand with the airlines.\nKim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.\nReporter : hyosunee88@gmail.com",

A growing number of countries have decided to keep schools shut until the worst of the virus is over, and are taking their classes online.\nBut this poses challenges not only for teachers and students, but parents as well.\nTo discuss how all those involved can handle these new responsibilities and abrupt changes, we have joining us today Mr Glenn Gallagher, a teacher at Mayport Coastal Sciences Middle School.\nWe also have Dr. Suh Sooyeon, Professor of Psychology at Sungshin Women's University in Seoul.\n\nGlenn Gallagher: It seems online or virtual classrooms are taking off in the U.S. for university students. But how are school teachers coping with the transition especially for younger students?\n\nDr. Suh: In South Korea, most families have their children's academic year scheduled down to the hour, with after school activities and private tutoring filling up most of their day while the parents are at work. With the drastic change to the school year, children have been home for more than two months how has this impacted the modern family culture?\n\nGlenn Gallagher: What are some things parents should prepare for and keep in mind during this transition to online learning?\n- online education curriculum tools? High-speed internet? Separate study rooms?\n\nDr. Suh: Also, having children at home and managing their education can be more than a handful for parents. Is it normal to feel overwhelmed, and how should parents handle their stress?\n\nDr. Suh: Children must also be stressed about not being able to go to school and meet their friends on top of their worries about the coronavirus. How should parents guide their children through this period of uncertainty?\n\nGlenn Gallagher: How will the coronavirus pandemic change the way children learn, not only academically but also socially?\n\nThat's all we have time for today. Thank you very much for joining us, Glenn Gallagher in Florida and Dr. Suh Sooyeon in Seoul.\n\n\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",

What do these downgraded projections tell us about the possible pace of recovery?\n\n2. (To Dr. Ong-Webb) The airline industry is one of sectors directly hit by the pandemic. The International Air Transport Association says airlines may burn through 61 billion dollars of their cash reserves during the second quarter of this year, and post a quarterly net loss of $39bn. That's a 71 percent drop. The crisis has also worsened existing challenges and vulnerabilities in the aerospace and automotive industries. Will these sectors be able to survive, even with massive bailouts? How vital are they to restoring our economies?\n\n3. (To Dr. Larry) So far the biggest stimulus plans we've seen amount to around 10 percent of GDP. But some say, we're facing a situation worse than the Great Depression when global Gross Domestic Product fell by 15 percent between 1929 and 1932. Is the current level of spending enough?\n\n4. (To Dr. Ong -ebb) Current policies will inevitably leave parts of the corporate sector with even larger debt burdens. Could this lead to a protracted recession and additional layoffs that last well beyond the virus?\n\n5.Should we be thinking of provisions for future debt restructuring?\n\n6. We keep hearing about the need for a global coordination in policy - even a global Marshall Plan. What would this entail?\n\nThat's all we have time for today.
