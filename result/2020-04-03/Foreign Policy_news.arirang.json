We have significantly narrowed our differences and expect to reach a final deal soon.\"\n\nSouth Korean media reports say this time, the Special Measures Agreement, or SMA, will be good for several years, most likely five years.\nWashington had been demanding Seoul pay 4 billion dollars just for this year, but it's reportedly lowered that amount.\nOnce they've signed, the South Korean government is expected to work on getting the deal ratified in parliament by May 29th.\n\nIn the meantime, starting today, 4-thousand South Korean workers at local U.S. bases have been put on unpaid leave.\nThe U.S. had said before that it would furlough these workers starting April 1 if a deal were not reached by then.\nThe South Korean workers' labor union held a press conference at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek.\n\n\"Putting South Koreans on unpaid leave jeopardizes not only the workers' liveliloods but also the safety of American soldiers and their families. It's now time for the South Korean government to announce realistic assistance policies and protect South Korean workers.\"\n\nSouth Korea's defense ministry expressed regret about the furloughs and said it will work with parliament to enact special laws to support the livelihoods of the people affected.\nOh Jung-hee, Arirang News.\nReporter : jhlucyoh@arirang.com",
