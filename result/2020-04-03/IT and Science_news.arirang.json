This is very often considered a radical prescription, but I feel increasingly workers will have to get a share of profits, so not a huge amount. You don't want to distort incentives, but our share of profits ought to go to workers just like shareholders get income from the shares. Workers should own shares and begin to add something. This is a long run thing that our economists and America economists around the world who are beginning to talk about it.\"\n\nThe economist suggests more workers will gradually move into the creative sectors, and new jobs will come from healthcare and industries that require human interaction.\nBut the challenge now is to minimize the fallout during the transition.\nOh Soo-young, Arirang News.\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",

Korea\u2019s COVID-19 testing facilities\ncapture the spotlight of foreign media\n\nThe first drive-through testing centers set up on Mar. 23,\nat Gyeongbuk National University Hospital in Chilgok\n\nThe first to devise the idea of drive-through testing\nDoctor in charge of treating S. Korea\u2019s first COVID-19 patient\nKIM Jin-yong / Dept. of Internal Medicine, Incheon Medical Center\n\nQ. WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING?\n\nTesting at a medical facility can only take place once every 30 minutes to an hour for each person, but drive-through testing allows us to conduct each test in under 10 minutes. We can also set up multiple lanes to speed up the process even more.\n\nWhen testing saliva samples, we simply give people a container that they can spit in while their windows are rolled down, which is then given back to us, so it is relatively safe.\n\nKIM Jin-yong / Dept. of Internal Medicine, Incheon Medical Center\nFirst person to propose drive-through testing methods\n\nQ. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA OF DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING\nDuring the early stages of the outbreak here in Korea, there was a need to conduct tests quickly due to the rapid spread of the virus.\n\nAs part of my personal research, I studied the concept of Point of Dispensing (POD), which are facilities used to distribute medicine in the event of a biological terror attack. In the process of determining those sites, I realized that it could also be located outdoors, and that disease testing could also be conducted in a similar manner. But, instead of carrying out tests in an enclosed area, such as a trailer or a container, I thought doing so in the open air would provide natural ventilation and prevent the virus from spreading to other people. Even if the person is infected, they are isolated within their own vehicles, so I figured it would not be a problem.\n\nUnited States / United Kingdom / Germany / Belgium / Denmark / Australia\nCountries around the world scrambling\nto adopt drive-through testing\n\nQ. ADVICE FOR OTHER COUNTRIES ADOPTING DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING\n\nAlthough testing is quick, there is a risk of cross-sample contamination.\n\nTherefore, it is very important to constantly change your gloves and covers after they have been used to test a person.\n\nThe weather is getting warmer now and summer will arrive soon. People being tested may be feeling irritable in higher temperatures and that is something to be careful about.\n\nQ. NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n\nIt is sad news that the COVID-19 outbreak is escalating rapidly in the United States, particularly in New York City where the number of patients is rising at a similar rate as was seen at the onset of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. I have been in e-mail contact with a doctor based in New York City over the weekend to talk about how patients are being treated there. Before the outbreak, it took months for medical findings to be published in a research paper, but now they have to shared on a near-daily basis on the spot. Also, how can we utilize the world\u2019s limited resources in an effective manner? That is also an important question that deserves serious consideration. We have a limited pool of material, human and intellectual resources and I believe it\u2019s important to use them in a productive manner.\n\nQ. A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL\u2019S ENTREATY\nIt has now been three months since the world came to learn of the existence of COVID-19. During that time, scholars, doctors and researchers from all across the globe have worked tirelessly to try and better understand the virus. However, some countries have failed to properly respond to the outbreak despite their wealth of expertise, and the developed world is no exception.\n\nInstead of giving into exaggerated fears, we must find a way to return back to our normal lives by following the recommendation of government authorities and experts, while continuing to practice safe social distancing measures. That is the path we must take moving forward.#\n\nReporter : leejun@arirang.co.kr",
