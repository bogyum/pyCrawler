In spring, health experts recommend maintaining an indoor humidity level of between 50 and 60 percent. But as we can see, it's only half that outside right now, so we need to humidify our homes and drink at least 2 liters of water a day.\n\nAlso be extra careful when handling fire because there's no precipitation in the forecast for the time being in the capital area. Temperatures will continue to be on the mild side with wide gaps between the lows and highs.\n\nIt's going to be a breezier morning tomorrow compared to today, though. Seoul and Daegu at 5 degrees.
