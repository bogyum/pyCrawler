            "context": "Tokyo 2020 became the first Olympic games to be postponed due to reasons other than world wars meaning that what has happened with this year's games is unprecedented.\nThere are huge ramifications of postponing an event of this magnitude, no less for the athletes themselves and for broadcasters.\nOur Sports editor, Paul Neat, is back in the studio this week.\nPaul, first of all, what are some of the ramifications for South Korea's Olympic athletes specifically?\n\nWell, there are huge ramifications for all involved. But for the athletes themselves they have been training for the last four years and should be heading into peak condition when the games were set to begin. But for some, they may not even be able to compete in 2021.\n\nIn terms of reactions, there has been a mixed response. Olympic gymnastics champion Yang Hak-seon has expressed his concerns about whether he will be in peak condition in a year's time. Park Sang-young , the men's fencing gold medalist from Rio 2016 said that he has more time to prepare, but admits he will have to be mentally focused. Another fencer, and world number 1, Oh Sang-uk , says it will enable him to have a break and spend time with family.\n\nBut, modern pentathlete Jun Woong-tae says it doesn't change anything and that he is still confident.\n\nInteresting. For some athletes who are in danger of being unable to compete in 2021 it may be because they have come to the tail-end of their careers but for some it's because of age limits.\n\nThat's right, Connyoung. In men's Olympic football, for example, only 3 players in the 18-man squad can be over 23. Around 10 members of the South Korea team will be over that age next year. Competing in the Olympics will obviously be a career highlight for many, but for South Korean footballers it is a chance to earn military exemption if they win a medal. Some, like Song Bum-keun from Jeonbuk are already exempt, but for others it could have a huge impact on how their careers pan out. Teams in Europe can be put off if a player has to go to the army.\n\nGiven what's at stake, will this require a change in the rules? What have the Korean Football Association said about this?\n\nYes, it will. And so the Korean Football Association have written to the International Olympic Committee and FIFA to request a change in the rules and allow players who were 23 at the time of the original Olympics to be able to play. They have said that it is \"unfair\" for their players not to be able to compete due to age restrictions.\n\nWith millions around the world who were set to watch the Olympics, the postponement is sure to cause complications with broadcasters too.\n\nAbsolutely, in the U.S. for instance, NBC Universal had sold 90% of its commercials for the Games, worth 1.25 billion dollars. For the IOC themselves, over 90% of its income comes from broadcasting rights. It's believed that a lot of these advertisers will switch to next year, but logistically there is an enormous amount of work involved. NBC are working on contingency plans and have a lot of staff already in Japan but are facing a \"significant content crisis.\"\n\nThank-you for that update, Paul. We will see you next week.\nReporter : paul.neat@hotmail.co.uk",

Why did Tokyo and IOC change their tone all of a sudden and why did it take so long?\n\n\n[Jerry] Now it\u2019s postponed to 2021, what comes next for the athletes and can all of them keep their Olympic dreams alive?\n\n\n[Jerry] Taekwondo has been on the official Olympic program since 2000, but the 2020 Games is quite special because taekwondo was set to make its Paralympic debut at Tokyo 2020. How has the decision to postpone affected the Federation and the athletes?\n\n\n[Tariq] It\u2019s safe to say Tokyo and IOC made the right decision to postpone. What are some of the logistical and financial problems ahead before summer 2021?\n\n\n[Jerry] Finances are also be a headache for the athletes, especially if they can't secure sponsorships for another year. And for some athletes, a year's extension could be too long to wait. What kind of complications do the entrants face?\n\n\n[Tariq] Most people assumed the Games will be held around roughly the same July-August timetable but this would clash with other major sporting events. IOC President Thomas Bach said earlier dates in 2021 were possible. Do you think there\u2019s a chance that we would be having a \u2018Summer Olympics\u2019 in April or May instead of July or August?\n\nThat's all we have time for today.\nThank you for joining the program, Tariq Panja in London and Jerry Ling in Seoul.\n\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",

            "context": "With the COVID-19 outbreak getting progressively worse in Europe, the leading football associations have been left with no choice but to put their respective leagues on hold. Not only that, international football tournaments have also been postponed. Our Sports editor, Paul Neat, is in the studio with us this week. Paul, what's the latest?\n\nConnyoung, during an emergency video conference this week, UEFA made the decision to postpone the 2020 European Championships. The tournament was originally scheduled to start on June 12th, and take place across 12 host nations.\n\nThis will allow European domestic leagues to finish their seasons. Ending the seasons now as null and void would result in huge financial implications, particularly in terms of broadcast deals. The broadcast deal for the English Premier League, for example, is worth about 4 billion U.S Dollars a year.\n\nSo, with this news, do we know when leagues in Europe will start up again?\n\nTaking England for example, after a meeting on Thursday, the EPL and EFL announced that games in the top four divisions are to be postponed until April 30th at the very least.but said they are \"committed\" to finding a way to complete the season.\n\nIf or when the season does pick back up again, it should allow Liverpool to officially seal the Premier League title. They are 25 points clear and very close to a first league crown in 30 years. It also means that there's time for Son Heung-min to return to fitness and help guide Tottenham to European qualification.\n\nStaying in Europe for a moment, a South Korean footballer currently in Europe has tested positive for COVID-19, what can you tell us about that?\n\nThat's right. Suk Hyun-jun, who has had something of a nomadic career. Beginning in the Netherlands and has gone on to play for 11 different clubs in five different countries. He is currently in France, playing for second division side Troyes where he was confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19. He is now recovering and in isolation.\n\nThere's also potentially alarming news over in Spain too as it has been reported that 35% of Valencia's first team squad have tested positive for the virus teammates of South Korean wonderkid Lee Kang-in. Only two players have come out and announced that they have tested positive, Ezequiel Garay and Eliaquim Mangala, though. They are of course now in isolation.\n\nPaul, you mentioned Lee Kang-in just there, he has been touted as a player who could be part of South Korea's Olympics football squad but, given what has happend with the European Championships, will the Olympics suffer the same fate?\n\nWell, the International Olympic Committee had said this week that they \"remain fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\". Thomas Bach, the head of the Olympic Committee, said they are \"considering various scenarioscancelling is not one of them.\" Adding: \"It is a unique exceptional situation, which requires exceptional solutions.\"\n\nHowever, a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee has said publically that the games should be postponed.and will argue her case at a meeting on March 27th.\n\nOkay, thank-you very much for that update, Paul.
