With social distancing rules relaxed by a bit, we expected a boost in the country's travel industry.\nWere you able to witness a pick up in travels over the long holiday?\n\nWhere were people traveling to? What activities have been popular?\n\nWere you able to find any unusual pattern that was different this past long holiday from this time around in previous years?\n\nSouth Korea's southern resort island of Jeju is a popular destination for travels in the country especially this time of the year for its picturesque scenery and beautiful blue ocean.\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic this year, a larger-than-projected number of tourists visited the island during the golden holiday. Let's go down to Jeju.\nLinking up with us live from Jeju is Rhee Kang-il, General Manager of Overseas Marketing for Jeju Tourism Organization.\n\nGeneral Manager Rhee, thanks for joining us.\n\nNearly 140-thousand tourists visited Jeju on over the long holiday. Is Jeju recovering from the initial coronavirus blow?\n\nJeju has always been one of the popular tourist destinations for travelers, both from overseas and domestically.\nUnlike the mainland, Jeju has not yet shifted to \"distancing in daily life.\"\nStill under strict social distancing, how has Jeju been handling incoming travelers?\n\nFor travelers planning to visit Jeju, what guidelines are in place for them to follow?\n\nIt seems to be a double-edged sword as incoming travelers boost local economy, but opening doors also means becoming vulnerable to the risk of infection.\nAre residents of Jeju worried at all about a COVID-19 outbreak with the recent influx of travelers?\n\nIs COVID-19 leaving any permanent changes to the travel industry of Jeju?\n\nRhee Kang-il, General Manager of Overseas Marketing for Jeju Tourism Organization, thanks for speaking with us.\n\nWith how long people have had to stay at home, as we saw over the recent holiday, people are eager to get out. International travel is still expected to be slow since there are some countries that are still at the peak of the pandemic.\nBut while it's expected to take time for the overall economy to recover, how do you foresee the recovery progress for the travel industry?\n\nAs an agency that promotes travel in Korea, what are your recommendations for those who would like to stay virus free AND explore around?\n\nHow do you expect COVID-19 to change the way we travel? or bring about changes in the travel industry?\n\nBefore we let you go, why don't you give our viewers three travel spots of your recommendations in Korea?\n\nKim Byeong-sam, Secretary General of Korea Tourism Association, many thanks for speaking with us this evening.

Are there certain figures or numbers that health authorities use to decide when to relax certain level of social distancing?\n\nI don't know if you were out yesterday or this past weekend, but people were out and about enjoying the warm weather, shopping, eating out - most of them in masks, but a worrying number not.\nIs this concerning to you? How likely is it that the reopening of society will lead to a resurgence of COVID-19?\n\nThe country's 5.5 million elementary, middle, and high school students are going back to classrooms in stages with high school seniors leading the pack on May 13th.\nAre there safety measures in place? Parents remain divided over the issue of their kids going back to school - we saw the case in Singapore where they saw a huge resurgence as soon as kids went back to schools.\n\nAre there specific distancing in daily life guidance for churches? We remember a large number of COVID-19 infections in South Korea early on were traced back to church services. Sunday services were canceled for a while, but they're back in service again.\n\nHave hospitals adopted new ways to prevent further spread of the virus?\n\nIt appears South Korea is gearing up for a second outbreak of COVID-19 in the fall or winter. The government announced it would designate and operate 1-thousand respiratory clinics. What does this mean? How would these clinics help prevent spread of the virus?\n\nSouth Korea's rapid reduction of its new infection rate has caught the eye of governments and public health officials around the world.\nMany other countries have imported South Korea's testing kits and adopted the country's test, trace, and treat regime. Yet, the kind of containment and mitigation haven't been replicating in other countries such as the U.S. Are there other factors in play?\n\nMany say we can never fully return to normal life until a vaccine is developed. Or even a treatment drug.\nRemdesivir recently earned FDA approval for emergency use in severe COVID-19 cases. Now, does this mean that this antiviral drug from Gilead has proven to be effective in treating COVID-19?\n\nAre there other promising treatment drugs under clinical trials?\n\nDr. Alice Tan, Arirang's go to medical professional, many thanks as always for your valuable insights.
