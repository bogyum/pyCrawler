Third year high school students already restarted classes last week.\nTo prevent the spread of the virus, schools have been disinfected, everyone's temperature will be checked twice a day and those who show symptoms will be sent for further examination.\n\nIt could be tougher to get elementary students to follow the virus prevention guidelines, so teachers are taking extra precautions.\n\nTeachers have placed stickers on the floor to tell students to keep their distance from their classmates.\nAnd they will constantly remind students to wash their hands and wear face masks.\n\n\"Parents are used to online classes, but are still happy about resuming in-person classes. We did a survey and found out that parents want to send their children to school once a week which means that many are still worried about preventing the virus.\"\n\nElementary school students can choose whether or not to have lunch at school but around one-third of students at this school have decided to have their lunch at home.\n\n\"We have a compact class schedule to allow students to go home by 1 PM. If the parents don't want them to have school meals, they can go home right after the end of class.\"\n\nThe Education Ministry is planning to hire 30-thousand after-school instructors, retired teachers and volunteers to help students follow the guidelines and prevent the spread of the virus.\nJang Tae-hyun, Arirang News\nReporter : tommyjang@arirang.com",

Today, 100 percent of the passengers so far have have been wearing masks.\"\n\nNow, passengers without a mask can be refused boarding or be asked to get out of buses or taxis.\nNot only the drivers but also people who take public transport every day have already noticed the difference that the law is making.\n\n\"I commute by public transport and around 90% of people were wearing masks. But with the new law, I haven't seen anyone who was not wearing it.\"\n\nAlong with this measure, the government is taking steps to make it more comfortable to wear masks in hot weather.\n\nThe government has also announced it will increase imports of dental masks as experts are now saying that they are safe enough and more suitable in hot weather.\"\n\n\"Compared to dental masks, KF masks are uncomfortable and are hard to breathe through when wearing for a long time. So people are likely to wear dental masks. Also, ordinary people who are not exposed to the risk of direct infection are scientifically proven to be safe enough with dental masks.\"\n\nThe expert added that on public transport, dental masks can significantly lower the chance of infection if an infected person and the people around them are all wearing masks.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News\nReporter : smkim@arirang.com",

But now 13 countries claim to have seen it in children.\nMeanwhile, Korea has further concerns relating to COVID-19 as authorities have reported more cases linked to the Itaewon cluster.\nEpidemiology results confirmed a new case linked to Itaewon in the seventh degree meaning the cluster infection has spread into local communities.\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News\nReporter : tkim@arirang.com",

The disaster relief money has led to consumption, which has slowed the decline in sales of small businesses, while credit card sales have recovered to last year's level.\n\nPerhaps a reflection of that, consumer confidence recovered slightly in May.\nData from the Bank of Korea showed the consumer sentiment index at 77.6 for this month, up 6.8 points from April.\nThe central bank attributed the improvement to the slowing pace of new infections, the resumption of economic activity amid eased social distancing, as well as the government's relief funds and other stimulus measures.\n\nIt saddens me that people have had to tighten their belts due to the economic contraction. I feel a sense of satisfaction that the disaster relief money has been able to warm the hearts of vulnerable people.\n\nThe president also thanked those that have donated their share, saying that the funds will be used to help secure jobs and support people who have lost their jobs.\nMoon added that it's hard for the government's fiscal measures alone to deal with an emergency situation like this, stressing that whether it's consumption or donations, he hopes it gives the country strength to overcome the crisis.\nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.\nReporter : kimmj@arirang.com",
