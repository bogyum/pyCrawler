If it happens, we'll address that issue very strongly.\"\n\n\"Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong and the Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. What legislation the HKSAR introduces and how and when it enacts the legislation is entirely within the scope of China's sovereignty. The U.S. has no right to criticize or interfere. If the U.S. is bent on harming China's interests, China will have to take all necessary measures to fight back.\"\n\nRising tensions between the world's two superpowers, U.S. and China coming under the spotlight in the wake of the latest protests in Hong Kong.\nIt's the topic of our News In-depth with Mason Richey, Associate Professor of International Politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies live in the studio with me..\n\nOver the weekend, thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets to oppose the China's move to go around Hong Kong's own legislature and draft measures against secession, foreign influence and terrorism. What are Hong Kongers protesting about exactly?\n\nWith his plan to impose sweeping antisedition legislation on Hong Kong, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has revealed a willingness to alter the onetime British colony's special status as a self-governing city with a speed and scope that has surprised many, from pro-democracy activists to diplomats to businesspeople.\nWhat does this move suggest about Xi's shift in his approach to Hong Kong? What is Xi Jinping attempting to do ultimately?\n\nThe U.S. has said it would slap China with sanctions should Beijing move ahead with the implementation of this law. What does China's such move mean for the U.S., really?\n\nFor many months, China watchers have been they were not overruling the Hong Kong authorities. Now, they are cracking down. It feels like U.S. President Donald Trump has been praising Xi when he wanted the trade deal and now the gloves have come off as he's campaigning.\nWhat do you make of this downward spiral and how dangerous is it for the rest of the world as tensions brew between the world's two superpowers?\n\nAmid this global pandemic, China has foregone their customary growth target, which they've set every year since 1994. Every year, they've achieved that target, and often, a fair bit more.\nFriday, Chinese Premier Li announced that they have not set a specific target for economic growth.\nAn indicator of great uncertainty, why have they not set a growth target, and what does it mean for the world's second-largest economy?\n\nRising tensions between the United States and China are spilling over into the airline industry.\nWashington has accused Beijing of blocking American carriers from resuming flights to China, prompting U.S. authorities to more heavily scrutinize Chinese airlines.\nWhat can you tell us about this?\n\nChina is also demanding that the U.S. withdraw sanctions on tech suppliers. So, the spillover effect from the U.S., China tensions is rather extensive. Is the world ready for for the two superpowers to go head to head?\n\nWhat is your forecast on the Hong Kong issue? How do you foresee things to unfold on that front between the U.S. and China?\n\nMason Richey, Associate Professor of International Politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, many thanks as always for your insights.
