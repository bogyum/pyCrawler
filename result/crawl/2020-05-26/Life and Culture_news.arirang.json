Yet they are portrayed very differently as quick and dynamic monsters. Some people even call them \"K-zombies\". Korea's Joseon dynasty also provides unique and attractive visuals.\n\n'Extracurricular' is another \"can't miss\" Korean show.\nThis teen crime drama tells the story of a high school student who has been abandoned by his parents and leads a double life.\nCritics say fans of Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' will enjoy 'extracurricular', which the Los Angeles Times called the \"cream of the crop\" of the Korean dramas produced by Netflix.\n\n\"Of course, director Bong's Oscar-win paved the way for the worldwide audience to pay more attention to Korean content. But a more fundamental reason behind the attention is that streaming services such as Netflix offer an escape from the regulated drama format, freedom from the subject and capital.\"\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Korean dramas, Kim recommends 'Crash Landing on You', a love story set across the divided Korean peninsula.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",

I believe the series could be popular with two directors' own strengths brewed together.\"\n\nThe series has already attracted much attention from the global press.\nThe BBC has praised the series, saying viewers should look no further than this drama to quench their craving for content that tackles issues we are currently facing.\n\n\"The reason why Bong's work is attracting lots of fans is because it deals with the issue of 'class'. Snowpiercer shows how people are worried about dropping down from their current class. It also gives us a warning that conflict between classes and even system destruction could happen if we don't take care of such issues.\"\n\nThe TV series can also go into more depth and offer a more detailed plot that the movie couldn't provide due to the lack of time.\nThe first two episodes are already available on Netflix, and a new episode will be released every week.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\n\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",
