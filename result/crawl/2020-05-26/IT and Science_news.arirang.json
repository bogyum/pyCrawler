Doherty's Nobel Prize-winning research revealed how our immune system recognizes virally infected cells.\nAnd his institute, the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity was the first outside China to sequence the COVID-19 genome, grow the virus, and share its research internationally.\nWe ask Dr. Doherty today about the global response to COVID-19 and his take on how we can best fight the virus and end this pandemic.\nThank you for joining us today\n\nWhat has surprised you about COVID-19 compared to other epidemics you've observed in your time?\n\nWhat do you think about countries reopening despite not entirely flattening the curve?\n\nSweden has been claiming relative success with its herd immunity experiment. But it's among the 10 countries with the highest numbers of deaths per capita. Is herd immunity advisable and can it protect people against a possibly more deadly second wave of COVID-19?\n\nCountries like South Korea and Australia managed to greatly contain and lower community infection cases. But does that mean we are more vulnerable to a second wave, as the majority of us have no immunity to the virus?\n\nHow would you advise South Korea or Australia to ride out a potential second wave?\n\nThe question on everyone's lips: When do you think a vaccine will be available?\n\nThe Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity has been collaborating with the University of Queensland on a vaccine candidate. Your institute was actually the first outside China to sequence the COVID-19 genome, grow the virus, and share your research internationally. How were you able to respond so quickly and how is your vaccine candidate coming along?\n\nWhat are some of the unique challenges of developing a vaccine for COVID-19?\n\nYou've also emphasized the importance of developing drug treatments as well as vaccines. What is more urgent at this point?\n\nIn the meantime, what's the best way to keep our immune systems strong and ensure they don't fail us if or when a second wave strikes?\n\nResponses from the world's most powerful leaders were muddled, to say the least, and a lack of leadership has unnecessarily compromised many people and healthcare workers. What danger does this pose to public health?\n\nDo you have any words of advice or warning for leaders or governments that are politicizing the pandemic?\n\nWe'll have to let you go now. Thank you for your insights and for taking the time to share these crucial facts with people around the world.\nPeter C. Doherty, Immunologist and Professor at the University of Melbourne and Nobel Laureate of Physiology or Medicine.\nThank you for joining us.\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",

            "context": "We start a discussion with a public health scientist in the United States.\nAs the world grapples with a public health crisis of an unprecedented scale in the 21st century, scientists across the globe are working day and night to develop a vaccine.\nAs of now, there are around 70 research groups worldwide, working on over 100 potential vaccines in different stages of development. This week, the first results of human trials by U.S.-based Moderna Therapeutics' offered a glimmer of hope. Out of the 45 volunteers in the study, eight were found to have produced key antibodies that work against the virus. The news has been encouraging but most members of the scientific community have cautioned that the development should be taken with a grain of salt, and maintain that a vaccine is likely to take much longer than a few months to hit the market.\nTo discuss the progress made so far in developing a vaccine for COVID-19, we connect with Dr. Eric Ding, a Visiting Scientist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health.\n\nLet's start with Moderna's results. It seems scientists have welcomed the news but remain on the fence until there are more details provided about the test. Do you agree there's insufficient information?\nWhat do you think is the most crucial information missing from the test?\n\n- Another question is that Moderna didn\u2019t answer was whether or not their vaccine generated a T-Cell response.\n\n- How would an mRNA vaccine that they're developing work against COVID-19?\n\n- How durable and long-lasting would the neutralizing antibodies have to be to make sure it works?\n\nSome say it's seems too much of a coincidence that Moderna's former executive was appointed to lead America's vaccine project. What do you think about this?\n\nThe University of Oxford's vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response but couldn't prevent transmission. Why is it difficult to achieve both?\n\nThere's also the fear that a vaccine could do more harm than good. What are the complications scientists are trying to avoid during the development process?\n\nWhen do you think a vaccine will be on the market?\n\nSome doctors and patients say remdesivir has been effective in treating COVID-19. Is it possible that drugs like these could be repurposed or adapted before a vaccine comes out?\n\nIt seems the absence of effective treatments as well as the hurdles to developing a vaccine demonstrates a failure of government policy and bureaucracy in every country. How should government policies and regulations change to provide consistent support for scientists?\n\nIn the meantime, with a second wave on the way, what should people without immunity do to ensure their bodies are in tip-top condition?\n\nWe'll have to wrap up our discussion here but we really appreciate your insights and your efforts to raise the level of public awareness on the facts we need to know.\nDr. Eric Ding, epidemiologist and health economist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health -- thank you for joining the program.\n\ned: mark\n\n(New York, U.S.)\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",
