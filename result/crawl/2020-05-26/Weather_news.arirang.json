What's the weather looking like at the moment?\n\nWell, Conn-young. We're seeing some isolated showers in central regions including the capital, Jeollabuk-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do provinces. Most areas have only seen about 5 to 20 millimeters of rain, but we\u2019re seeing some scattered thunderstorms. Most of the rain will stop by the end of the day, but in Jeollabuk-do and Chungcheong-do provinces, the rain will last until tomorrow morning.\n\nWe can expect warmer conditions, or even sweltering weather at times, as we go through the week. Daytime highs can get up as high as 28 degrees Celsius on Sunday. Wide temperature gaps of 10 degrees on average are expected for the week, so please make sure to take extra layers with you.\n\nFor tomorrow morning, Seoul will begin the day at 13 degrees, Daegu 16 and Busan 17.\n\nSunny spells are expected all across the nation in the daytime, with highs hovering around 24 to 27 degrees. Jeju will be a bit lower with 22 degrees.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Tokyo will see rainy spells for a second straight day, so for those in Japan's capital, make sure to grab an umbrella.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
