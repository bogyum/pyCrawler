The change continues and will continue as ever in a tremendous way.\nOn top of this, North Korea's United Front Department added to the criticism of the South.\nAccording to the North's Rodong Sinmun on Saturday, Pyeongyang has threatened Seoul over anti-Pyeongyang leaflets sent by North Korean defectors.\nPyeongyang said the act of sending leaflets is insulting to the North Korean leader, calling them more dangerous than South Korea-U.S. joint military training.\nNorth Korea's Jang Kum-chol, head of the United Front Department, said that inter-Korean relations have already reached a point where they cannot be fixed.\nJang further added that Seoul will now face difficult times, adding that the trust between the two Koreas has been destroyed.\nEarlier this week, North Korea cut all communication lines with South Korea. Meanwhile, in Seoul, the government has not yet made an official response to the North's latest statements.\nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.\nReporter : peterwjchoi@gmail.com",

I wanted to come here with my kid as the hiking course is not that tough either.\"\n\nThe volcanic activities have also created this estuary, where fresh water meets with the ocean.\nThe tide's ebb and flow can even be seen in this lake.\nAnd in the afternoon, the water level goes down by up to 2 meters.\n\n\"Tourists can also take a ride on one of Jeju's traditional fishing boats, known as Taewoo. The wooden boats were once used by haenyo, or the island's iconic female divers.\"\nAnd people can use kayaks to get up close to the volcanic cliffs.\n\nBut Manjanggul cave may offer a truly exceptional experience, taking you into the actual passageways that lava once flowed through.\nMeaning \"very deep\" in local dialogue, the tunnel shows the delicate footprints of the lava flow, from which its direction and thickness can be estimated.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been to other caves before but I\u2019ve never seen one this big.\"\n\nSome 170 volcanic caves have been discovered so far, of which four are open to the public.\n\nLee Kyung-eun, Arirang News, Jeju.\nReporter : kelee@arirang.com",
