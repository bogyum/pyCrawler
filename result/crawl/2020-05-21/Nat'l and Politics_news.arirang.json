The question is whether we will still have the same security with these new methods. Enforcing the new law for security standards is key.\"\n\nMeanwhile, one citizen told us that any trepidation for new systems will soon disappear.\n\n\"I am scared of exposing my information. But seeing as though I was scared at first to use Kakao Bank and have no fear about it now, I feel like they'll just become part of our daily lives.\"\n\n\"The current public certifications are usable until they expire, after which, people can make a new certificate using the simpler authorization and renewal system being developed by the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute.\"\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News\nReporter : tkim@arirang.com",

We are also looking forward to enhancing the effectiveness and bring more awareness to people.\"\n\nIn order to prevent further contamination while testing possible drunk drivers, all traffic officers will be required to wear face masks and sanitize their hands.\nIn the meantime, the police will be able to resume its crackdown using the non-contact detectors until the COVID-19 outbreak has stabilized.
