Such an act tears down the dignity and honor of the victims.\n\nThe controversy centers around activist-turned-lawmaker Yoon Mi-hyang of the ruling Democratic Party, who led the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance an NGO for the sex slavery victims.\nShe's been accused of misusing public donations meant to support the victims, who are now mostly in their 80s or 90s.\nCurrently, there are 17 registered survivors still living.\nThe allegations emerged after former comfort woman Lee Yong-soo raised suspicions with the organization's accounting practices now under scrutiny.\nMoon said that the latest controversy has served as a chance to look back on how civic groups operate.\n\nThe government will use the controversy as a chance to establish a consolidated system for donations and to fundamentally strengthen the transparency of all activities to collect donations and raise funds.\n\nPresident Moon expressed hope that the controversy and hardship will become an opportunity to further develop the comfort women movement,. noting that the wounds of the victims have not been fully healed, and that reconciliation and a sincere apology from Japan have yet to come.\nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.\nReporter : kimmj@arirang.com",
