The season has changed from winter to summer.\nAfter seeing the first case of the coronavirus in January, we saw COVID-19 spike to as high as 850 a day flattened to as low as single digit new cases daily. But, in recent weeks, we've again seen that number back up in the high 30s, 40s and 50s. It appears that's the nature of this virus. As soon as we think we may be seeing the end of it; as soon as we let our guards down, or loosen our vigilance a little bit, a cluster infection breaks out somewhere. What do we do?\n\nWe are beginning to see temperatures rise across the nation. In fact, the first heatwave advisory of the year was issued in parts of South Korea today. How do we expect the heat to affect COVID-19?\n\nWith days to only get warmer in the weeks and months to come, South Korea introduced the sales of a a new type of face masks designed to be more breathable than the N95 or KF94 respirators while shielding the wearer from respiratory droplets.\nHow much protection do these 'breathable' masks provide? It had been advised up until now here in South Korea to wear KF80 or KF94 masks.\n\nThough not without unrest, the last group of students in South Korea returned to schools today in the final round of the government's four-phased reopening plan.\nThat doesn't mean, of course, all of the nation's 5-point 9 million grades K to 12 are back with their regular curriculum at school. The pandemic is obviously impacting school learning for students not only in this country but around the world and will continue to do so for some time.\nHow do pandemic of such scale impact learning for kids and what needs to be done to ensure children's education in times of pandemic?\n\nMeanwhile, New Zealand announced today that there are no known novel coronavirus cases in the island nation for the first time since COVID-19 arrived there on February 28th.\nFrom midnight tonight, New Zealand will move to alert level one one - and a return to mostly normal lives.\nJoining us live from New Zealand is Professor John Fraser, Dean of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland.\nDean Fraser, thanks for joining us.\n\nBefore New Zealand went on strict nationwide lockdown, when the number of new COVID-19 cases were soaring, what were your first reactions to COVID-19?\n\nAs a medical expert, to which measures do you give most credit in bringing down COVID-19 cases to zero in New Zealand today? And, for your low fatality rate?\n\nStill, the latest relaxation of restrictions does not lift border controls to New Zealand. From a medic's perspective, when is a good time for New Zealand to open up borders?\n\nWhat can we do to prevent a second wave of the pandemic?\n\nDean John Fraser of the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland, thank you for speaking with us. We appreciate it.\n\nFinally, we're heading towards mid-June which means our families living overseas may start to visit us for the summer. What's the current set of guidelines for a family of four, for instance, to be visiting South Korea at the moment?\n\nDr. Alice Tan, as always thanks so much for your expertise and insights this evening. We appreciate it.\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",
