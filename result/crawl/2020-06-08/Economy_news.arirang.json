The hearing has lasted all day long except for a one-hour lunch break.\n\nProsecutors suspect illegalities over the merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries in 2015.\nThey accuse the management of intentionally lowering the value of Samsung C&T's shares and inflating those of Cheil Industries, to help Lee secure control of the company as he was Cheil Industries' largest shareholder.\nProsecutors suspect Lee was also involved in the matter.\nThe management is also accused of allegedly inflating the value of pharmaceutical company Samsung Biologics, a subsidiary of Cheil Industries.\nThe alleged moves are seen as a bid to cement Lee Jae-yong's power over the group and facilitate succession from his ailing father Lee Kun-hee.\n\nSamsung claims that the 2015 merger followed due process, and the accounting of Samsung Biologics has complied with international accounting standards.\n\nLee last appeared before the press at court last October on separate charges of bribery under the former Park Geun-hye administration.\nAnd he was imprisoned in 2017 for about one year for bribery under the Park administration.\n\n\"The result of Lee's arrest warrant review will likely come out late Monday night or early Tuesday morning.
