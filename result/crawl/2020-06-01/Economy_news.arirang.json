Please follow my instructions as I call out your name. For the rest of the applicants, please stand by with your face towards the camera.\"\n\nPrior to the tests, Samsung sent each applicant a package containing equipment needed for the exam, such as a smartphone holder.\nApplicants were required to record a video of themselves using their smartphones and the smartphone holder, and ensure the video shows their screen, mouse, and their hands for the supervisor to monitor in real time.\nAn online orientation took place a few days before the actual exam, to check the connection and testing system.\nWith Samsung leading the way, some say the demand for remote hiring may increase in the future, as it saves time and expense compared to offline recruitment.\n\n\"This non-contact recruitment can reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the time and cost of the existing hiring process. I think it's going to continue to be an option in the future.\"\n\nSamsung's evaluation of the online recruitment process was also positive.\nIt said no cheating or program malfunctions have been reported so far.\nThe group says it plans to upgrade its online hiring system based on the results of this exam, and is considering expanding remote recruiting to other areas after making some adjustments.\nMany expect Samsung's hiring for the second half of this year to also be held online.\nKim Jae-hee, Arirang News.\nReporter : jhee@arirang.com",

Geopolitical uncertainties have also delivered a blow to the heavily export-dependent economy. And with the economic fallout of the virus expected to last months possibly years it's clear that the country's industries need to turn the pandemic crisis into an opportunity to build new engines of growth.\nTo discuss how Korean exports will be affected down the line and how businesses can reinvent themselves, we connect with Dr. Yang Jun-sok, Professor of Economics at the Catholic University of Korea. We also have joining us Dr. John A. Quelch, Dean of the University of Miami Herbert Business School.\n\nDr. Jun-suk Yang: South Korea's exports fell again during the first twenty days of May, due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. With the spread of COVID-19 and its economic fallout expected to rumble on for the foreseeable future, with no one knowing when global demand will bounce back, which industries will take the biggest hit?\n\nTo both: How will South Korean companies, particularly SMEs be affected by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war?\n\nDr. John A. Quelch: U.S. President Donald Trump says his administration's working to revoke Hong Kong's special trading status. If this happens, what will be some of the major changes?\n\nDr. Quelch: Chinese state media have said the U.S. is bluffing when it says it will end Hong Kong's special status? Do you think it's likely, and over the coming weeks, do you think Washington and Beijing will try to at least negotiate?\n\nDr. Yang: What does the uncertainty over Hong Kong mean for South Korean businesses, especially SMEs?\n\nDr. Quelch: In the meantime, South Korean companies need to somehow restructure and reinvent themselves in the global market. Throughout the decades, South Korea is focused on being a fast follower than a first mover of new technologies, products and services. What do you think have been the main limitations or barriers to innovation?\n\nDr. Yang: South Korea is aiming to boost its so-called \"non contact\" sector, or digital services sector by boosting medical and education technologies. Do you see a big potential there and what kind of barriers need to be tackled first?\n\nDr. Quelch: Which industries or products do you think Korean companies should focus on growing as new engines of export growth?\n\nDr. Yang: South Korea's central bank cut its key interest rate to a historic low of 0.5% last week. Will this help boost the economy for now? Or is it a bit pointless now?\n\nThat's all we have time for today but thank you for your incredible insights.\nDr. Yang Jun-sok, Professor of Economics at the Catholic University of Korea, and Dr. John A.
