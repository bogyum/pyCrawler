Make sure to wear a mask and wash hands frequently. Please refrain from singing and shouting, as that could cause droplet infection, and it is best to avoid large group meals.\"\n\nSo far, there has been one death related to the cluster infection from recent religious gatherings and another patient is in a critical condition.\nThree additional cases related to the Bucheon logistics center were reported on Monday bringing the total number of related cases to 1-hundred-12.\nOf these, 74 were the center's employees while the rest were infected through contact with them.\nDescribing logistics centers and telemarketing offices as high risk groups for infection, the head of the central disease control headquarters also called for measures to create safer environments for these businesses.\nShe added that distancing in daily life in schools and education facilities is also crucial as they could potentially become the roots of further cluster infections.\nSouth Korea's total confirmed cases now stand at 11,503, with the death toll at 2-hundred-71 after one additional death on Monday.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News\nReporter : smkim@arirang.com",
