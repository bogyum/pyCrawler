It's sparked global reaction from all around the world.\nThis latest incident adds to what brought rise to the activist movement Black Lives Matter in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin in February 2012.\nThat wasn't the first, nor the last, and each time reactions of the people are growing.\nFirst off, why don't we begin with the background of such tragic incidents in the U.S.?\n\nSo this happened on May 25th, in a neighborhood in Minneapolis. Admist an arrest of African-American George Floyd by white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Can you outline the key points of the incident?\n\nFloyd's family lawyer has come forth asking for a first-degree murder charge against the officer. In support of this claim is that for 2 minutes and 53 seconds almost a whole 3 minutes after Floyd became unresponsive, the officer kept Floyd pinned to the ground with his knees. How do you see this case unfolding?\n\nWhy did Floyd's death spark such widespread, visceral outrage, while three other deaths of African Americans this year - Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Tony McDade, a black transgender man killed by police officers in Tallahassee - did not?\n\nWould you say the protests are no longer just about George Floyd?\n\nThe protest in New York turned violent as some protesters looted and vandalized stores in the SoHo neighborhood. There are concerns that these violent lootings and vandalism obviously can't be encourage and are of completely different nature from the peaceful protests against George Floyd's death.\n\nThe challenges will surely reverberate through the year and beyond in ways that are impossible at the moment to predict. For Donald Trump, not to mention through November's election.\nHow do you expect the latest protest to impact the upcoming election?\n\nNot only in the U.S., but the tragic incident is sparking reaction from different countries around the world. How do you expect this global movement to unfold?\n\nAs Martin Luther King Junior pointed out more than fifty years ago, \"a riot is the language of the unheard.\" It seems like a growing number of people in America feel unheard today in 2020.\nMason Richey, Associate Professor of Political Science at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, many thanks as always for your insights this evening. We appreciate it.\n\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",
