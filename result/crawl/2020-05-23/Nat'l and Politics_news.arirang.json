But none of that is possible in a singing room: you can't sing with a mask on, and you are in a small space with other people for a long period of time.\"\n\nOne of the singing room's customers then came in contact with the one-year-old baby.\nAnd a man who visited a PC cafe in the same building also tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"Experts suggest elevators could be a possible source of transmission within buildings.\nThey say despite the anti-virus film, the virus can still live up to 4 hours.\"\n\nTaxis and private academies are also at the center of the spread due to their enclosed environment.\nAnd in such cases, it only takes a brief moment of contact for transmission to occur, as proven by CCTV footage of two students who had a single minute of contact in a classroom.\n\nTo cut this long chain of infections, social distancing is critical.\n\n\"Let's say, to stop a secondary infection from developing into a third degree transmission, you have to quarantine everyone who has had contact with patients in that particular stage, so they can't pass it onto others. The most effective way to do that is by voluntary distancing.\"\n\nSelf-hygiene such as wearing a mask and washing hands regularly can also help break the chain.\n\nLee Kyung-eun, Arirang News.\nReporter : kelee@arirang.com",
