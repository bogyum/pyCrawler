So people are buying not only necessities but also things that they have been eyeing for a while.\"\n\nRestaurants and food franchises, on the other hand, have seen no significant rise in sales, apparently because the aid distribution has only just begun.\nThe recent cluster infection linked to nightclubs has also stopped people from going to and eating at crowded places.\n\n\"From Monday to Thursday this week, almost 8 million households have applied for the funds.
