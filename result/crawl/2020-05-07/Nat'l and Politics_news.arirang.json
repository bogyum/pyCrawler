It was rather the public's collective, voluntary participation that helped stabilize the situation.\"\n\nSo high intensity social distancing, but also like you said, isolation and the robust medical system were critical in the city's fight against the outbreak, weren't they?\n\nAbout two months ago, the city saw an exponential surge in cases, mostly linked to the Shincheonji religious group.\nAnd that's when city's medical system was on the verge of collapse.\nBut the city introduced the so-called \"temporary care center\" system, which was used to house patients with mild symptoms so more hospital beds could be kept for severe patients.\nThis quarantine system helped the city reduce the total damage from the outbreak, and became an innovative model for other countries.\nAnd by April 30th, all 15 centers had closed after releasing all their patients.\n\nLastly, medical staff who've come from all parts of the country played a critical role, as did the support and medical resources from the central government.\n\nThe Daegu city government is planning to publish the lessons it has learned from the outbreak after it completely ends.\nBack to you Conn-young.\n\nAs always, our gratitude to all the healthcare professionals working day and night in the frontlines.\nAnd, thanks, Kyung-eun. Great coverage.\nReporter : kelee@arirang.com",

The fifth of the personal virus prevention guidelines was to 'keeping hearts closer while distancing.' Although staying apart, it is important to call your parents and send your regards.\"\n\nStarting from Wednesday, South Korea has been gradually easing its social distancing measures.\nStill, such advice for Parents' Day comes as many experts warn of a potential second wave of COVID-19 cases.\nAlthough the country has seen less than five new cases for each of the past three days the government says there are still some cases where it is hard to trace the infection route.\nTherefore, while thanking the public for their efforts, the minister also asked that people keep practicing virus prevention measures in their daily lives.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News\nReporter : smkim@arirang.com",

So, the Ministry of Education has advised turning on the air conditioning with the windows open at least one third of the way.\"\n\nThe ministry will set up a task force ahead of opening day to be ready to support students and teachers when they start coming back next Wednesday and beyond.\nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.\nReporter : peterwjchoi@gmail.com",
