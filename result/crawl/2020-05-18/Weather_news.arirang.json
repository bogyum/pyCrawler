There are sporadic showers here in the capital at the moment. Taking a look at the current readings, rain clouds are making their move from the west coast and are spreading nationwide. Heavy showers are expected in the capital and this is likely to cause traffic congestion tonight, so please be prepared.\n\nAs the clouds are travelling vertically through the Korean peninsula, rain is concentrated more on the northern regions. The highest amount of precipitation expected is in the upper parts of Gangwon-do Province of about 200mm. In the capital and Gyeonggi-do Province, we'll be expecting up to 80mm. There's also the possibility of hail in some central regions and in Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, so watch out for that as well.\n\nTomorrow morning will be relatively chilly. Seoul will start off at 12 degrees Celsius and Daegu at 13 degrees.\n\nDaytime highs will be 4 to 9 degrees higher with Seoul at 17 degrees and Daegu 20 degrees.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Tokyo will also have rainy spells while Beijing will see periodic clouds.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
