The ones in the era thought they owed it to the people involved in this movement. This universal idea led to the June Democratic Movement in 1987, which led to a huge step forward in our democracy.\"\n\n\"40 years after the 518 Pro-Democratic Movement, the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History has set up a special exhibition so visitors can remember the sacrifices Korean citizens made for democracy.\"\n\nIt's the largest exhibition of its kind to be seen in Seoul, and the first time many of the items on display have left Gwangju.\nA foreigner visitor tells us the exhibition is an example for the rest of the world.\n\n\"Okay, so, I studied in Hong Kong last semester, and at the moment, the political movements are still going on\u2026 and so it's quite shocking that 40 years ago this also happened in Korea and that it's still going on today\u2026 but I think it is definitely like, Korea's a better place now that it's more democratic.\"\n\nWhat happened in Gwangju, a city far from the capital, changed the course of history, not just for the city, but for the nation.\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News\nReporter : tkim@arirang.com",

So we said \u201cwhy are you going this way? Do you know where Yanglim-dong is?' He said, 'Oh yes,' but he said, 'soldiers.' I said, 'soldiers?'\"\n\nAs the crackdown intensified, Martha began to see thousands of people injured or killed by the soldiers, being delivered to Gwangju Christian Hospital.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers even then in Downtwon Gwangju, were attacking people, and a number of our friends because we had so many student friends were injured very much during that period. They pulled him off the bus, kicked him in the stomach, kicked him in the back, kicked in the head, and then he lost an eye.\u201d\n\nAs Gwangju came under attack, Martha felt united with the people.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve been there for 15 years, and all of our work was for and with the people of Gwangju. They had shown us nothing but kindness and grace and acceptance, and we honestly believe that if they were all going to die, we should die with them.\u201d\n\nMartha was frustrated by the government's censorship in the press of what was actually happening.\nSo she and her husband decided to let the world know the truth by taking pictures of innocent civilians.\nMartha returned to Gwangju in 2018 to commemorate the anniversary of the May 18th Pro-Democracy Movement.\n\n\u201cAnd to come into the memorial park, I almost went to my knees. I almost dropped to my knees, so overwhelming.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the May 18th Democratization Movement Truth Commission started an investigation this year, to find out who was responsible.\n\nThe commission said the goal is to seek truth and reconciliation, not punishment, but the painful memories of the May 18th Pro-Democracy movement still live on for many people.\nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.\nReporter : peterwjchoi@gmail.com",
