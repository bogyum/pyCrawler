            "context": "First baseball, then football and now golf. The 42nd KLPGA Championship teed off on Thursday and became the first global golf tour to restart since the coronavirus outbreak. Our Sports editor, Paul Neat, is back in the studio again this week. Hi Paul, K-Sports are leading the way it seems\n\nHi Connyoung, yes it does. It has been five months since we saw any golf action since the season opener in Vietnam last December. The increased level of intrigue and popularity has meant that the tour is being broadcasted in several countries around the world, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan. In addition, SBS Golf are broadcasting the event on YouTube in English.\n\nThe tournament couldn't go ahead without the necessary safety measures being in place. As well as the usual temperature checks and health questionnaires, what other measures are being taken?\n\nPlayers are required to practice social distancing and they are also required to sanitize their clubs. Players and caddies have a separate path and a separate, temporary clubhouse. There are also no galleries, or spectators, in attendance at the Lakewood Country Club in Yangju. .\n\nWhich players are involved and who should fans look out for?\n\nSeveral of the sports top stars teed off on Thursday, including world number 3 Park Sung-hyun, world number 6 Kim Sei-young, and number 10 Lee Jeong-eun. In addition, defending champion, Choi Hye-jin, is also taking part. At just 20 years old she already has 9 KLPG wins to her name and seems confident. She said her \"goal is to retain her title\", and that she is \"happy with her ball-striking\" but it will be a case of \"getting her feel back for the game\".\n\nAfter two days, what is the current state of play?\n\nWith two days to go, Bae Seon-woo is leading at 12 under par, followed by Kim Ja-young and Heo Da-bin both at 8 underpar.\n\nSwitching to K League now, the football season kicked off last Friday and, with his winning goal for Jeonbuk, Lee Dong-gook seems to have sparked the ' ', or 'Thanks to You' challenge, within Korean footbal, hasn't he?.\n\nYes, it does seem so. A K League legend with over 220 goals to his name, Lee Dong-gook scored the only goal of the match against for Jeonbuk against Suwon last Friday - a game which was viewed by millions around the world. To celebrate his late winner, Lee Dong-gook ran over to where the Jeonbuk fans would normally be, and displayed the 'thanks to you/ ' gesture.\n\nThe trend seemed to catch on as a handful of players over the course of the opening weekend followed suit such as Kim Seung-dae of Gangwon FC, Andre Luis of Daejeon Hana Citizen, and teams even lined up for their pre-match photographs whilst posing. Perhaps Dejan Damjanovic, your guest on News In Depth on Tuesday, will get of the mark for his new club when Daegu face Pohang this Saturday.\nGerman Bundesliga restrats this weekend behind closed doors.\nThe decision was made on April 30th. Two months later, it's back.\nIt's the first of the Europe's top leagues to be back.\nThe league in France has been canceled already.\nThree Korean internationals are playing in Bundesliga. They are\n\nBat-flipping in KBO seems to have caught the attention of baseball fans in the U.S., it seems as though fans are really taking to Korean baseball?\n\nYes, it does seem so. In MLB, bat-flipping can be seen as something that is a bit disrespectful to the opposition and can be frowned upon. But, it is something that has been a part of KBO for a long time. KBO bat flips are a bit more exaggerated than MLB and are sometimes done a bit prematurely which can add to the entertainment value. So, weather permitting, I am sure we will see more bat-flipping in KBO over the course of the weekend.\n\nYes, let's hope so. Well, thank-you for that update, Paul. We will see you next time.\nReporter : paul.neat@hotmail.co.uk",

U.S. sports giant ESPN acquired exclusive broadcast rights to South Korea's national baseball league. Some 36 countries sought out media-rights deals with Korea's football league ahead of the opening weekend. It provided some comfort and a sense of returning to normalcy for sports fans everywhere. To discuss what Korean sports has to offer and what fans will have to get used to in this new normal of empty stadiums, joining me today, we have\nDan Kurtz, a U.S. based KBO expert who created MyKBO.net and KIM Taeryung, Director of Fitogether, a data-based football management company.\n\n\nBoth: It\u2019s been a week since both sports leagues kicked off and enjoyed a rare global audience. How have they been received so far overseas? -- and what did you make of the response?\n\nBoth: How do you think the games have been handled so far, in terms of health and safety -- and do you think this model could be replicated in other countries?\n\n: Players also have to stop themselves from high-fiving or talking to each other. Did you sense any awkwardness among the players?\n\nDan: The strange silence is one baseball players and the fans will have to get used to. Do you think empty stadiums affect the players\u2019 performance?\n\n: The Bundesliga, Germany\u2019s professional soccer league, is set to restart this week. There's also the possibility of the English Premier League returning next month. Many say attention on the K-League will eventually fizzle out for international football fans. What do you think about that? What can they do to retain global interest?\n\nBoth: In addition to K-pop and K-culture, how do you think South Korean sports can keep the momentum going and be a part of the new Korean wave?\n\nIt's been a wonderful discussion. Thank you both for joining the program today. Dan Kurtz founder of MyKBO.net and KIM Taeryung, Director of Fitogether.\n(Tacoma, U.S.)--\n\n(Seoul, S. Korea)\n\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",
