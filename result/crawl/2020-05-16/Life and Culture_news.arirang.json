Ironically, this enabled us to bring together more local artists, who are getting a chance to perform at a time when their own events have been canceled.\"\n\nSome 32 performers will be participating until May 29th under the theme of \"Little Heroes Come Together\".\nThe theme was changed at the last minute due to the outbreak to honor those citizen heroes who have contributed to society.\n\nThe outbreak has also changed the way artists prepare for the stage.\n\n\"Typically, the team practices together in the studio. But this time, it was all done by studying video of past performances and discussing it through live chats.\"\n\nAs for the audience, because of COVID-19, they have to sit one seat apart from each other.\nAnd all stages are live-streamed via NAVER TV and V LIVE for everyone to watch at home.\nSome 15-thousand people tuned in on the first day of the event.\n\n\"By using the online platforms for the first time, the festival aims to reach more people, and send positive energy to help them get through the crisis together.\nLee Kyung-eun, Arirang News.\nReporter : kelee@arirang.com",

Are there certain figures or numbers that health authorities use to decide when to relax certain level of social distancing?\n\nI don't know if you were out yesterday or this past weekend, but people were out and about enjoying the warm weather, shopping, eating out - most of them in masks, but a worrying number not.\nIs this concerning to you?

Parents remain divided over the issue of their kids going back to school - we saw the case in Singapore where they saw a huge resurgence as soon as kids went back to schools.\n\nAre there specific distancing in daily life guidance for churches? We remember a large number of COVID-19 infections in South Korea early on were traced back to church services. Sunday services were canceled for a while, but they're back in service again.\n\nHave hospitals adopted new ways to prevent further spread of the virus?\n\nIt appears South Korea is gearing up for a second outbreak of COVID-19 in the fall or winter. The government announced it would designate and operate 1-thousand respiratory clinics. What does this mean? How would these clinics help prevent spread of the virus?\n\nSouth Korea's rapid reduction of its new infection rate has caught the eye of governments and public health officials around the world.\nMany other countries have imported South Korea's testing kits and adopted the country's test, trace, and treat regime. Yet, the kind of containment and mitigation haven't been replicating in other countries such as the U.S. Are there other factors in play?\n\nMany say we can never fully return to normal life until a vaccine is developed. Or even a treatment drug.\nRemdesivir recently earned FDA approval for emergency use in severe COVID-19 cases. Now, does this mean that this antiviral drug from Gilead has proven to be effective in treating COVID-19?\n\nAre there other promising treatment drugs under clinical trials?\n\nDr. Alice Tan, Arirang's go to medical professional, many thanks as always for your valuable insights.
