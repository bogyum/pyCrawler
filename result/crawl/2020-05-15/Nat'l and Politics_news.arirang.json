So far, there have been no cases or indications of fourth-degree infections.\"\n\nIn terms of age, 15 people confirmed with the virus are younger than 18.\nSome of them were infected by their teacher at a private academy in Incheon.\nMeanwhile, the government is going to hold a briefing next Tuesday on guidelines for high-risk facilities like clubs, which right now are closed.\nAnd since the weather is warming up, that will include guidelines on air conditioning in public places.\nAs of Friday, the total number of cases reported in South Korea stands at 11,18.\nAnd as of Thursday at 6 PM, almost 37-thousand people were in self-quarantine, a number that's been rising since the Itaewon outbreak was first discovered.\nJang Tae-hyun, Arirang News\nReporter : tommyjang@arirang.com",

The number of patients kept skyrocketing but Daegu didn\u2019t have enough hospitals or ambulances to deal with all the people.\u201d\n\nHelping Daegu in its time of need were the huge number of firefighters who came in from all over the country.\nMore than 900 firefighters descended on the city and moved close to seven-and-a-half-thousand patients during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cSeeing hundreds of ambulances gathered in the same place for the first time and all the paramedics speaking different dialects from different regions was overwhelming. We only had one aim: to send patients to a safe environment.\u201d\n\nGearing up was physically grueling.\nShe had to go through the so-called 5 steps: putting on her protective suit, pulling on her overshoes, wearing goggles, a mask and gloves.\n\n\"When you have all this stuff on, it's very hard to hear and see. Above all, as the day warmed up, the protective suit got so sweaty and stuffy.\u201d\n\nWhat helped her overcome those difficulties and focus on the task at hand was her sense of duty.\n\n\u201cBeing a firefighter is about serving citizens and saving people in danger. That's the reason I decided to become a firefighter and that's what made me endure the discomfort.\u201d\n\nDaegu has now largely flattened the curve thanks to the hard work of medical staff, fire fighters and the city's citizens. With Seoul seeing another big community-based transmission, she says it's time for the country to pull together again.\nShe added the challenging times Daegu went through provided invaluable experience about how to systematically respond to the crisis.\nChoi Jeong-yoon, Arirang News, Daegu.\nReporter : jychoi@arirang.com",
