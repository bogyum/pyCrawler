I'm going to buy feminine products and snacks, which I need now and will always need in the future.\"\n\nTopping people's shopping lists were rice, sanitary pads, shampoos and diapers.\nIn fact, sales of rice at convenience stores jumped over 48 percent on Wednesday from the previous day.\n\n\"Customers are buying instant rice in packs and looking to buy more expensive products like bluetooth earphones. I think people are spending the money freely because it's not going to sit in their bank accounts forever.\"\n\nPeople also went on shopping sprees at convenience stores for items that are normally more expensive there.\nSales of razors for shaving rose well over 70 percent.\nAnd normally slow sellers like wine and ginseng sticks also jumped by double digits.\n\n\"The relief money is available for everyone in the country. So people are buying not only necessities but also things that they have been eyeing for a while.\"\n\nRestaurants and food franchises, on the other hand, have seen no significant rise in sales, apparently because the aid distribution has only just begun.\nThe recent cluster infection linked to nightclubs has also stopped people from going to and eating at crowded places.\n\n\"From Monday to Thursday this week, almost 8 million households have applied for the funds. They'll have the end of August to spend it, so local consumption will see an increase, brightening up local markets over the next few months.\nKim Dami, Arirang News.\"\nReporter : damikim@arirang.com",
