This also gives me a sense of responsibility.\"\nI can see that the K League has done a lot of preparation so the games can be played safely.\nAnd, it's spiked interest in a planet starved of live sport. What's the atmosphere there like? Is the opening match gaining traction?\n\nAbsolutely, Conn-young. And I can feel that from the atmosphere.\nHere's one of the foreign correspondents reporting on tonight's game.\n\n\"Having K League opened is allowing people to have a little bit of role model how it could be done in their own countries.\"\n\nThis game between Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors and Suwon Samsung Bluewings will be livestreamed worldwide, and 36 different countries have broadcast rights to the season, including Germany, Australia and the UK.\nAnd countries are also paying attention to the quarantine measures taken by the league that made this possible.\n\nThe K League has shared and explained those measures with football organizations in around 40 countries.\nBack to you Conn-young.\nReporter : smkim@arirang.com",

And, why?\n\nWhat have been the contributing factors that have enabled us to get this far?\n\nSome K League teams started playing competitive matches as early as January and February when relatively little was known about COVID-19. What measures were taken even then?\n\nSo, we know the games will be played without supporters in the stadiums, but other special safety measures must in place. I think I've heard talks of no talking among players on the field.\nHow does it work? Do you get a yellow card every time you talk to your teammate?\n\nSo, the Jeonbuk Motors - who have been champions for the past three seasons - face Suwon Bluewings in the opening game tonight down in Jeonju.\nLet's link over to the Jeonju World Cup Stadium to find out what the atmosphere is like there.\nPeter Hampshire, reporter for K-League United joins us from the opening game.\nHi there, Peter. Good to see you.\n\nPeter, this is a big game, involving two of Korea\u2019s biggest teams who have some of the loudest fans. But, there are no fans there tonight. What is the atmosphere like?\n\nHow is that affecting the players, do you think?\n\nTell us about your own experience in getting to the stadium tonight, what COVID-19 measures were taken?\n\nNo fans in the stands, but I understand there is a special banner displaying a message of support on the seats for fans watching around the world?\n\nThis game is being aired around the world on YouTube and Twitter so it could be one of the most watched games in K League history, what sort of benefits will that bring, do you think?\n\nPeter Hampshire joining us live from the opening game at the Jeonju World Cup Stadium, great job. Thanks.\n\nThat brings us onto what other countries and leagues will be thinking, what will they have learned from K League's model?\n\nIt has also created the opportunity for K League to tap into new markets around the world, 17 different countries have broadcasting rights now. How can fans in these countries choose a team to support?\n\nSo, for those who are perhaps tuning in to K League for the first time, what would you like to tell them? A beginners guide, if you will.\n\nMany thanks, Paul as always. We look forward to a great season forward.\n\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",

Paul, the big countdown is finally on\n\nYes, indeed. We are less than 24 hours away from the KBO season finally getting underway and in just a few days the K League season will kick off.\nWe know what the schedules look like as they were released last week, and, in KBO, we also know who the starting pitchers will be too after Sunday's Media Day. Three South Korean pitchers will start the season, the most since 2016.\n\nThat's great. Can you tell us who to look out for, which players have been pinpointed as being important for their respective teams?\n\nSure, due to Social Distancing measures still being in place, Sunday's Media Day took place online for the first time ever.\nDuring which, we learned that there will be 3 homegrown players as starting pitchers, Yang Hyeon-jong of Kia Tigers, who play Kiwoom Heroes, Baek Jung-hyun from Samsung Lions, they play NC Dinos, and Cha Woo-chan of LG Twins.We have not seen this many Korean pitchers start on opening day since 2016 (4), in 2017 all 10 teams sent foreign players out to the mound, and in 2018 it was 9, 2019 8.\n\nWe also heard which foreign players each captain is looking forward to seeing in action. Aaron Brooks of Kia Tigers and Chris Flexen of Doosan Bears were singled out by several captains. Both are former MLB players and set to play in KBO for the first time.\n\nThere are lots of interesting matches taking place tomorrow.\nWhich one will fans be looking forward to the most?\n\nWell, defending Champions Doosan Bears will get their season underway against rivals LG Twins. These two teams share the same stadium and will not want to lose against each other. LG Twins, though, will not have their two American right-handers, Tyler Wilson and Casey Kelly, available which will hinder them. Whereas Doosan won the Korean series last year, LG have not won the Korean series since 1994 and haven't appeared in it since 2002 so will be looking to get off to a good start.\n\nAs well as KBO, K League is back this week.\nWith an international audience set to tune, what can fans look forward to?\n\nIn at least 10 foreign countries, and potentially eight more, fans will be able to tune in to the season opener on Friday, Jeonbuk vs Suwon. These two teams have already played some competitive matches this year in the Champions League but weren't in the best form. Suwon lost both their matches, Jeonbuk managed to earn a draw against Sydney but lost against Yokohama F. Marinos at home so they will be looking to bounce back.\n\nOn Saturday. Last year's runners up, Ulsan Hyundai, who signed Korean international Lee Chung-yong during the winter, start at home to Sangju. Meanwhile, newly promoted Busan IPark are away to Pohang Steelers and Jeju United start life in K League 2 against Seoul E-Land.\n\nBefore you go, Paul, I believe there has been some positive news with the KLPGA?\n\nThat there has, after delays due to COVID-19, the KLPGA Championship will resume later this month and several of the sports top stars look set to take part. Ten-time LPGA winner Kim Se-young * as well as reigning US Women's Open Champion Lee Jeong-eun are planning to take part. Meanwhile, world no. 3 Park Sung-hyun and world no. 13 Kim Hyo-joo have also been rumored to be taking part. According to Yonhap, the tournament will get underway between May 14th and May 17th.\n\nThanks for that roundup, Paul. We will see you again on Friday.\nReporter : paul.neat@hotmail.co.uk",

I'm sure it's heavenly news for all the baseball fans out there. But, like everything else these days, it can't be the same as pre-COVID-19 days.\nThe games will be played in empty stadiums, but whatelse will be different about this season?\n\nThe empty stadium - I mean, how can talk about Korean baseball without the boisterous fans, the cheers, the chants?. lack of off-days, the players not being able to high-five, the season that will be played into November and post-season beyond that. How do you expect these factors to affect players' performance?\n\nWell, why don't we find out how the teams are gearing up for the big opening day tomorrow.\nJoining us live from South Korea's southeastern city of Busan, home to Lotte Giants is Sungmin Kim.\nHi Sungmin, thanks for linking up with us.\n\nAfter a more than month-long delay, what's the overall atmosphere like out on the field? Are players excited, relieved, worried to be starting the new season in the COVID-19 pandemic?\nWhat about the coaches and managers?\n\n(With the delay of over a month, how is the physical condition of the players? Have they been training during the delay period?\nHas COVID-19 put any restraints on their training?)\n\nThe season is kicking off with no fans in the stands. Lotte Giants is especially known for their fervor cheering. Will the silence in the stadium affect players' performance?\n\nSungmin Kim, Associate at the R&D Department for Lotte Giants, thanks for speaking with us tonight and best of luck to you throughout this season.\n\nThere were reports that ESPN was negotiating a deal to broadcast the games - meaning there could be Korean baseball on TV for American audiences.\nDo we have any updates? I mean, the season starts tomorrow so, if it were to happen, I'm thinking the deal should have been inked by now.\n\nESPN wanted rights to broadcast South Korean professional baseball games for FREE How was this interpreted by KBO?\n\nBaseball stadiums will gradually increase stadium capacity open for fans, but it is inevitable that all KBO teams will take a financial hit - from tickets and merchandise sales.\nHow are the teams taking care of its finances? How are they paying the players, for instance?\n\nA large part of the industry's profits will have to depend on its games being televised.\nWhat measures is KBO having to take to handle its COVID-19 situation?\n\nAgain, this will be another challenge.\nNavigating every single day, surviving every game without any COVID-19 infections will require uncommon vigilance by the players, managers, coaches, by the fans.\nAnd, we know the other leagues around the world will be watching, learning and taking notes to learn, adopt, and adapt from the KBO experience.\nWe'll be looking to you two for our dose of Korean baseball for the next couple of months.\nYoo Jeeho of Yonhap News, Daniel Kim, DKTV - thank you both for a wonderful discussion tonight.
