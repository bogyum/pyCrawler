But I hear it's going to cool down with some rain on Parents Day tomorrow?\n\nRight, Conn-young. Like you mentioned, we experienced some intense heat during the daytime as temperatures were running about 4 degrees above average for this time of the year. However, for tomorrow we can expect lower temperatures with more clouds than sunshine. On Saturday, we'll be seeing daytime highs of 20 degrees in Seoul.\n\nThe reason the heat is subsiding is rain. It'll start in the western regions tomorrow night and will expand towards the east. By Saturday, rain clouds will have expanded all across the nation, and showers are expected to continue until Sunday. The south coast and Jeju Island will be seeing quite a lot of precipiation up to 30mm so please be aware.\n\nWe'll start off with cloudy spells tomorrow. Seoul will begin the day at 14 degrees, Gyeongju 8 and Daegu 11.\n\nDaytime highs will be about 1 to 3 degrees lower than today's.
