And air conditioning is not allowed, to prevent the virus circulating. We open the windows instead.\"\n\nThen, after the entrants' 2-week mandatory quarantine nears its end, a team of medical staff will conduct a home-visit for a second test using a moving triage center. But, for the medical workers, it brings about its own complications.\n\n\"It's hard when neighbors come and ask us which house we are visiting for testing, obviously we can't tell them. Also, most people want to keep things a secret so they ask us to get changed in areas that are out of site like on the stairs in apartment blocks.\"\n\nWith this extensive quarantine system, people arriving into the country are completely segregated from the moment they arrive to when they enter their homes.\nLee Kyung-eun, Arirang News, Daegu.\nReporter : kelee@arirang.com",

We ask those that could have been at those locations at that time to please stay home and refrain from going to work or going outside.\"\n\nHealth authorities also advise people who were out in Itaewon during those hours and who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 to get tested for the virus.\nThe first patient in this local transmission was not wearing a mask inside clubs and the time of his visit comes when his virus transmission level was high.\nThe government emphasized that this transmission at entertainment facilities is a case that alerts people about what can happen if they do not stick to disease prevention measures.\nThe government has also put an administrative order banning nightclubs across the country from opening for business for one month starting from 8 PM Friday.\nHong Yoo, Arirang News.\nReporter : yoohong@arirang.com",
