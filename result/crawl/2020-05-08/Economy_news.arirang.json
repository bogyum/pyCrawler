According to the survey, about 83 percent of people are dining mostly at home, up roughly 24 percentage points on-year.\nOf the respondents, 46 percent said the outbreak has them buying more ready-to-cook meal kits.\n\n\"As many people in South Korea have been refraining from dining out due to the outbreak, demand and the price of some staple food items have been on a volatile ride.\"\n\nAs of Friday, according to the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation, the price of 100 grams of pork was about 1 U.S. dollar and 84 cents, up roughly 14 percent from a year ago.\nAnd the average price last month of a pack of 30 eggs was about 4 dollars and 36 cents, the highest it's been so far this year.\n\n\"Prices have gone up. The price of food items like pork, eggs and vegetables have risen because they're so commonly used in our daily meals in daily lives.\"\n\nIt's widely expected that cooking at home, like some other lifestyle changes, could last beyond COVID-19 when life returns to normal.\nEum Ji-young Arirang News.\nReporter : jy_rachel@arirang.com",

Instead, their employees can work at these temporary workplaces.
