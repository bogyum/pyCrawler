But others experience extreme pain and discomfort, including strong aches and shortness of breath.\nWith hospitals overwhelmed as they are, many infected have to fend for themselves -- and recovery time can take several days to weeks.\nToday we speak with a Washington state resident who recovered from the virus -- to hear about what it was like for her and her husband, Chris -- and what we can do to support those who have the virus.\nSusan Kingsbury Kane. Thank you for joining us.\n\n\nFirst, walk us through how your husband initially became infected. What made you suspect you caught the virus?\n\n\nHow did the virus affect you physically? Which symptoms did you find the most difficult to cope with?\n\n\nIt must have been an upsetting time. How did you feel emotionally, especially with your husband being so ill at the same time?\n\n\n\nYour husband was in critical condition after getting COVID-19. Thankfully he has fully recovered now. How did his condition worsen and what kind of medical support did he need?\n\n\nIt was a very trying time for your family, and a lot to get used to in daily life. Self-quarantining is basically social isolation from your loved ones as well as from work. How did this affect your emotions?\n\n\nIn what ways do you think government workers or the medical system could support infected patients better?\n\nWe've heard reports of some people relapsing after getting better. Did you have any lingering symptoms or worry you may go through the same experience?\n\n\nIt's always encouraging to know that people are thinking about us in times of illness. What was encouraging for you and what can family members, friends, and the community best support those people with COVID-19?\n\nI believe you and your husband have been trying to help others recover from the virus as well. What have you been doing to support others -- and do you have any words of advice for those who are infected?\n\nThat's all we have time for today but it's been wonderful and so encouraging to speak with you Susan.\nThanks for joining the programme today.\n(Seattle, U.S.)\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",
