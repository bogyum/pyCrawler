And that kind of has implications of butting heads together.\"\n\nChina is also poised to tighten its control of Hong Kong by enacting new security laws aimed at quashing anti-government protests and other dissent.\nBeijing sees these laws necessary to protect China from what it calls \"external forces\" determined to undermine its sovereignty.\nThe proposal raises the likelihood of more violent demonstrations like those that gripped Hong Kong last year during which the U.S. said it would respond strongly to any crackdown in Hong Kong.\nA report to Congress released by the White House earlier this week shows the Trump administration is promising a \"competitive approach\" towards China that calls for a \"fundamental reevaluation of how the U.S. understands and responds\" to Chinese leadership.\nThe report claims Beijing challenges the \"bedrock American belief in the unalienable right of every person to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nKim Ji-yeon, Arirang News.\nReporter : jiyeonkim@arirang.co.kr",
