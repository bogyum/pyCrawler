But there have been gusty winds in some parts of the nation. What's in store for us tonight?\n\nWell, Conn-young. We're going to have to watch out for strong winds until tomorrow morning. In central regions, and on the east and west coasts, strong winds of up to 45km-per-hour are expected for tonight. Especially in Gangwon-do Province where a strong wind advisory has been issued, maximum wind speeds of 90km-per-hour are expected. These gusty winds increase the risk of wildfires, so please take extra precautions.\n\nTemperatures will be fluctuating until the end of the week. We'll have highs of 25 degrees Celsius tomorrow in Seoul but the mercury will fall back down again to 18 degrees, with rain in forecast until Saturday. It's easy to catch a cold at this time, so please dress accordingly.\n\nSkies will start off cloudy tomorrow morning. Seoul will kick off at 12 degrees, Gwangju and Daegu at 13.\n\nDaytime highs will be close to that of early summer and around 1 to 4 degrees higher than today's.\n\nRain is in forecast on Jeju island starting tonight and this will spread nationwide on Friday.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",

With the ultrafine dust and yellow dust coming in from overseas, air quality across the nation is not looking so great. Many of you might be wondering about the difference between the two. Well, as the name suggests, ultrafine dust are composed of smaller particles, so it can penetrate more deeply into our respiratory system.\n\nAnd that being said, fine dust concentrations across the northern region are forecast to remain at \"bad\" levels until tomorrow, while southern regions such as Gwangju and Busan will temporarily rise to \"very bad,\" so please be aware.\n\nWe had some pretty cool spells today but temperatures will rise back up tomorrow. On Thursday, the mercury will reach up to 25 degrees, which is the average for early summer. On Friday and Saturday, rain is in forecast nationwide.\n\nWe'll start off with sunny skies tomorrow, with Seoul and Gwangju at 10 degrees and Daegu 11.\n\nDaytime highs in Seoul will reach 21 degrees, Gwangju 23 and Daegu 26.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Tokyo and Beijing will have sunny spells.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
