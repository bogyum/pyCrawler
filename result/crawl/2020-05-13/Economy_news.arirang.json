Samsung SDI manufactures small batteries for smartpones as well as those used in electronic vehicles.\nThe newest batteries use solid electrolytes instead of the liquid type.\nCompared to lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in electric vehicles, the solid-state batteries are not only safer, but can store a greater amount of energy.\nLeading this new technology are South Korea's Samsung and Hyundai Motor Company.\n\nSamsung Electronics announced back in March the development of solid-state battery technology that has an 8-hundred kilometer range on just one charge.\nAfter creating its 'Electric-Global Modular Platform' last year, Hyundai now aims to mass produce electronic vehicles starting from next year.\nCombined EV sales of Hyundai and its sister company Kia reached over 24-thousand units in the first quarter of this year, becoming the fourth largest in the world after Tesla, the Renault-Nissan alliance and Volkswagen.\nAs the EV industry is one of the country's so-called 'New Deal' projects, the two conglomerates are expected to deepen and enhance their strategic partnership in this thriving industry.\nKim Dami, Arirang News.\nReporter : damikim@arirang.com",

The 15-to-29 age bracket saw the employment rate drop by 2 percentage points on-year to 40.9 percent.\nJob losses were mostly from service industries which require face-to-face interaction.\nThe restaurant and lodging sectors saw 212-thousand job losses compared to last year, and the education sector lost 130-thousand jobs on-year. The wholesale and retail sector saw 123-thousand job losses.\nAn expert in the field said there's a possibility the job market may further contract, and said the government should be focused on reviving industries hit hardest by the pandemic.\n\n\"It is expected that negative effect upon employment will increase to certain extend on the month of May and possibly June. The first thing is, the government's reaction has to be focused on certain industries, and second thing is, government has to be very active in preventing future unemployment.\"\n\n\"Amid the grim figures, the South Korean government will hold emergency economic meetings on Thursday this week and next week, and discuss ways to create more than 550-thousand jobs as early as possible.\nKim Jae-hee, Arirang News.\"\nReporter : jhee@arirang.com",
