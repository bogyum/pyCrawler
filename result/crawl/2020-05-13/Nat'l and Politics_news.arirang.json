So as long as citizens follow this new measure of wearing masks, I believe it will be safe to take the subway.\"\n\nWhen carriages are classed as \"congested\", people will be asked to put on masks, and further boarding will be restricted.\nThis level of congestion is when carriages reach over 150 percent of their recommended quota, based on the weight of 160 people in a carriage.\nSensors in the carriages can detect this weight and show current congestion levels.\n\nFor those who have forgotten to bring a mask from home, stations have placed vending machines that sell masks at street price.\n\n\"I totally support the change. I feel more relieved that people now have to wear masks on the subway. I also carry around extra masks just in case I forget to bring one.\"\n\nSeoul Metro is also planning to provide passengers with daily congestion forecasts for the following day on its website and social media like Twitter at 6 PM.\nFor the busiest lines including lines 2, 4 and 6, extra trains will run during rush hour.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News\nReporter : smkim@arirang.com",

But that's not happening right now.\"\n\nAnd because of the delay, a hectic semester awaits.\nAt least 5 major exams are planned, and midterms are set to take place just two weeks after students get back to the classroom.\n\n\"Of course that's not enough time to prepare. But what's more concerning is that most online classes are provided by EBS, the educational broadcast channel, but the actual tests will be made by our teachers at school. That means the material will be different.\"\n\nAlso, summer break will be shortened, leaving students with less time to spend in college applications.\n\nAll students can do at this point is take their classes online and study by themselves while waiting for school to get back to normal.\n\n\"Some students are also attending private academies.\nHere in Seoul's Daechi-dong, where many academies are concentrated,\u2026teachers and students are busy trying to fill the gap caused by the lack of school.\"\n\n\"Seniors have less time to prepare for the college entrance exam because they have to catch up with their school classes.

Watch out for cluster infections is what you said, I believe. Look at where we are now. Was this inevitable?\n\nWhat about this latest cluster of cases that can be traced back to the Itaewon area concerns you the most?\n\nThe KCDC announced yesterday that they have now identified two people who first showed symptoms as early as on May 2nd which could mean the Itaewon cluster may have \"various epicenters or sources.\"\nWhat does this mean and how does this complicate containment efforts for the health authorities?\n\nIt makes me wonder how else could the country have reopened up to avoid such breakout?\n\nThe other problem, though, is that at least one of the clubs patient number one from this Itaewon cluster visited was one that catered to members of the LGBTQ.\nAnd, that might make those who attended the nightclubs reluctant to come forward or be identified by the government. How can these hurdles be overcome?\n\nDue to these cluster infections, school reopenings which were set to begin in a staggered fashion in South Korea have been postponed once again by a week. High school seniors were initially supposed to be back at schools today. They won't be back until next Wednesday and even that isn't for certain, either. From a medical professional's point of view, what is the best way forward? I mean, kids will have to return to schools at some point. What is a good, scientific marker for that?\n\nIf and when our 5.5 million students go back to schools, what should be the 'new normal' in classrooms?\n\nThen again, news of children fatalities from a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome that could be linked to COVID-19 are being reported although few in numbers.\nIs this something we should be alert about?\n\nThe latest spike in cases shows how difficult it is to control the spread of this virus once strict lockdown measures have been lifted and the many complications that can arise when a country is opened up before a vaccine or an effective treatment for COVID-19 is found.\nUntil an effective vaccine is developed, is there an exemplary model that we could perhaps adopt and adapt?\n\nDr. Alice Tan, our favorite medical expert keeping us safe and sound in this time of pandemic, many thanks as always for speaking with us. We appreciate it.\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",
