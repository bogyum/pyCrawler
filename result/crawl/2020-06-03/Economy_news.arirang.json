This financial pump will create a virtuous cycle of financial recovery and contribute to the national economy.\"\n\nThe 29-billion-dollar supplementary budget comes from reallocating over 8 billion dollars of spending from other purposes, issuing 19.6 billion dollars of state bonds as well as using money from 8 local funds.\nThe latest supplementary budget also draws from some of the country's defense budget.\nAround 2-hundred 45 million dollars will be taken this time.\nIt's already the second deduction from the defense ministry's budget this year.\nAround 3.6 percent of the 2020 defense budget will be used to combat COVID-19, but the defense ministry has said that such a withdrawal will not affect its ability to carry out its goals and projects.\nWith a total of three extra budgets this year, the South Korean government will have poured 222 billion dollars into providing a financial cushion from the impact of COVID-19.\nAnd that's equivalent to 14 percent of the country's 2020 GDP.\nThe government will submit the budget proposal to the National Assembly on Thursday.\nAfter lawmakers' approval, the government plans to spend more than 75 percent of it within three months.\nKim Dami, Arirang News.\nReporter : damikim@arirang.com",
