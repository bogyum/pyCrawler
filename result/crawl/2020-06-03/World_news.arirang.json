After seven-hundred arrests, eight-thousand officers enforced the city's 8 PM curfew.\n\n\"New York City was looted. It was looted yesterday in Manhattan, middle of Manhattan, also in communities of color That is a very different situation. The police must stop the looting and the criminal activity. That is the essence of the police force. They are supposed to protect the community, protect the property. They did not do that in New York City last night.\"\n\nLast night, police officers themselves were being targeted.\nIn St. Louis, over night, several were shot as elsewhere, peaceful marchers took to the streets again trying to relcaim their voices and the narrative.\nAfter a week of protests chaos boiling over as one side of the police line demands order and the other justice - it's the topic of our News In-Depth tonight\n\nFirst, let's go to New York City for the latest. Mike Hale with the New York Times joins us live via Skype.\n\nMike, thanks for linking up with us.\nTell us. What are you seeing as you wake up to the ninth day of protests over George Floyd's death?\n\nBut, most of these protests have largely been peaceful laying down on bridges taking a knee chanting, marching. So, what is it that Americans want? What will it take for these protests to come to an end?\n\nDo you think this rage across the country will impact the race for the White House come November?\nIn other words, will Americans consider certain values as being more important now when they head to the polling booths?\n\nThe protests come as the U.S. struggles with the COVID-19 outbreak. Is covid spreading along with the protests? Are there concerns?\n\nMike Hale, critic for the New York Times, many thanks for linking up with us at such an early hour there in the east coast. Stay safe, Mike.\n\nAnd live in the studio for some analysis of the situation is Mason Richey, Associate Professor of International Politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\nMason, welcome back to the program.\n\nIt seems the protest over the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd is only growing in size and in intensity across the United States. Now in its second week, what, in your view, is fueling more anger?\n\nThis \"face-down hold\" means of immobilization technnique that police officers use is not an issue only in the U.S. It's a method criticized around the world and those cases are being brought back into light.\nDeemed dangerous, all forms of chokeholds are being scrutizined around the world.\nDo you think it's about time that lawmakers acts on banning this approach altogether?\n\nWhat will the protests mean to President Donald Trump in November?\n\nNow, what about for Joe Biden as he inches closer to clinching the Democratic nomination?\nIn the first public speech in weeks, he slammed the president's response to the protests saying President Trump is fanning the (quote) \"flames of hate\" and that America lacks leadership during this time.\nDo Americans see Biden as the leader that they lack at this moment?\n\nAdding to the distrust developed from the kind of leadership Trump showed with the COVID-19 break out, more people seem to be anxious about Trump taking on a second term.\nBut what we hear and assume isn't what we always see at the polls.\nWhy is that?\n\nAmerica for generations has presented itself as this shining 'city upon a hill', the exceptional, wonderful experiment, the melting pot, the likes of which other countries should try and imitate. That moral authority has been on the wane over the last few years.\nIs America losing its appeal? Is this the end of the American Dream?\n\nHopefully these international protests over the death of Mr. George Floyd will force leaders in America to do some serious soul-searching before it's too late.\nMason Richey, Associate Professor of International Politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, many thanks as always for your insights.

He said he'd like to invite South Korea, Australia, India and Russia.\nBut this unconventional move has caused some controversy.\nTo discuss this issue, we have joining us today: Dr. Kim Byoung-joo, Professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, and Dr. John Nilsson-Wright, Senior Lecturer at the University of Cambridge and Korea Fellow at the Chatham House.\n\nDr. Kim: Reacting to President Trump's suggestion of expanding the G7 summit, while excluding China, Beijing's foreign ministry and state-run media have shown expressed some skepticism. Do you think President Trmp will make it happen anyway?\n\nDr. NW: President Trump's move to include Russia in the G7 meeting has triggered negative responses from other G7 countries. How do you think this will play out?\n\nDr. Kim: President Trump hasn't done himself many favors over the past few years with his America first policy, while China's narrative over the COVID-19 outbreak, its move to control Hong Kong and its aggressive trade measures against Australia for instance throughout this pandemic has caused a number of countries to become wary. Can either of them get the backing they need from G7 countries and the plus four?\n\nDr. NW: Upsetting trade ties with China is something most countries want to avoid at all costs as most economies are already fragile.\nSo it looks like most governments are treading delicately. How should South Korea manage this juggling act?\n\nDr. Kim: President Trump has said the G7's outdated system does not represent the current international security situation. Do you think he's right? Could it be a chance for middle power countries like South Korea to play a more active role in the world?\nWhat kind of agendas should Seoul push for?\n\nDr. NW: Last year's G7 summit ended with President Trump lashing out at host Canada and retracting his endorsement of the joint statement. Is this an end to the current version of world order as we know it?\n\nDr. NW: What do you hope to see from the world leaders as an outcome of the summit?\n\nWe're going to have to wrap up the discussion here but it's been very insightful.
