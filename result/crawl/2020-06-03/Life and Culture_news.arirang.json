Back in 2011, his film 'Green Days' was also shown at Annecy.\nHe says he is delighted by this year's invitation as it lets him and his staff know that foreign audiences could be interested in an animated adaptation of a Korean novel.\nAhn also highlights the soundtrack to 'The Shaman Sorceress' as something worth paying attention to.\n\n\"I realized how Korean traditional instruments such as 'janggu' a double-headed drum could lead the sequence on their own.

At that time, Ahn shared his work process and presented traditional Korean instruments.\nHe believes this animation has received extra attention because it was made through 'teamwork production'.\n\n\"Although animation is a cooperative work, it is mostly considered as a director's personal work in Asia. This time, at the early stage, a lot of people including foreign staff participated in the work, for example when designing characters.\"\n\nThis year's Annecy festival will be held online in June, and along with 'The Shaman Sorceress', South Korean horror-thriller 'Beauty Water' will compete at the festival.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",

Visitors can see fortress sites, ancient tombs and stone pagodas from two thousand years ago.\nThe 'Folk Music Route' visits the homes of traditional music such as Pansori, the epic chant, and Ganggangsullae, a dance where people hold hands in a circle.\nOther courses track the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the royal palaces and structures of the Joseon Dynasty, as well as the Buddhist temples and monasteries hidden in Korea's mountains.\n\n(Korean- )\n\"All the courses can be done in 3 to 4 days and there's a relatively low risk of infections as cultural heritage sites are outside so people can keep a safe distance.\"\n\nAs well as the courses, regions around Korea are also restarting festivals and events so that people can experience the country's intangible cultural assets in person.\nThese events, which had been postponed due to COVID-19, include performances at royal palaces and fashion shows featuring traditional Korean clothing.\n\n(Standup/ed: dev)\nContaining more specific information, a guidebook will be distributed to tourists in four different languages, and a wide range of cultural content will be shared on social media.
