Your thoughts, Dr. Yang?\n\nThe South Korean government and the central bank are setting up an 8.2 billion dollar special purpose vehicle to directly purchase commercial paper in efforts to calm a local debt market hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe SPV would buy subprime debt as well as bonds with high credit ratings for six months AND low credit debt which were recently downgraded as a result of the COVID-19 shock.\nThis is a rare move by the Bank of Korea, isn't it?
