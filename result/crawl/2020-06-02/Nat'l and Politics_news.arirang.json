This will raise South Korea's national status and benefit the country's interests.\"\n\nTrump officially invited President Moon in a phone call on Monday, reiterating that the G7 is outdated and doesn't represent the current international situation.\nThe U.S. leader had earlier said that he was postponing the G7 summit until the fall and that he wanted to invite the leaders of South Korea, Australia, Russia and India expanding the G7 to a G11 or G12.\n\nMoon accepted the offer, saying that Seoul will fulfill its role in the areas of COVID-19 quarantine and economy.\nHe agreed that the G7 has limitations in dealing with global issues and finding solutions.\nMoon added that if the expanded summit is held face-to-face, it would be a milestone in the COVID-19 crisis, signaling that the world is returning to normal in terms of life and the economy.\n\nThe top office, meanwhile, brushed off concerns about hurting relations with China, especially at a time when ties between Washington and Beijing have soured over COVID-19 and Hong Kong.\nA senior Blue House official told reporters that there was no mention of China during the talks, and instead highlighted Moon's remarks that the expanded summit would be a milestone for the post-virus era.\n\nSeoul's top office said that President Moon was the first leader from the four invited countries that Trump called. It added that Moon said there was no reason to avoid the invite and that it was welcome news. Kim Min-ji, Arirang News.\nReporter : kimmj@arirang.com",
