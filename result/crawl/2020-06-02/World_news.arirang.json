            "context": "It's more than two millennia since the philosopher Socrates argued that humility is the greatest of all virtues.\nHis timeless observation was that the wisest people are the first to admit how little they really know.\nScience has been slow to catch up to this argument, but the last decade has offered a spate of new studies examining this trait and its effects on our thinking and reasoning.\nAccording to this research, people with greater humility are better learners, decision-makers and problem solvers.\nNever before than during this time of COVID-19 pandemic has such definition of leadership paid off as countries with leaders who tend to check his or her assumptions and listen to others' opinions before forming their own apparently dealing with the outbreak better than others.\nLeadership, it's the topic of our News In-depth. Live in the studio with us is Woo Byung-won, Associate Professor of Political Science at Yonsei University.\n\nWelcome to the program.\n\nFrom an academic perspective, how would you analyze the current governance leadership of South Korea in terms of pre- and mid- COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nHow do you think COVID-19 has shed light on different kinds of leadership styles? What kind of leadship has been exemplary in coping through times of a global health disaster, and what kinds not so effective?\n\nSince New Zealand's Prime Minister Arden's annoouncement of going beyond just controlling, and successfully eradicating COVID-19 outbreaks in New Zealand, the country continues to report zero new cases.\nSetting an example, a lot of attention has been brought on how women-led nations are coming out to be doing better with COVID-19.\nTaiwan is another example where President Tsai Ing-wen presided over one of the most successful efforts in the world at containing the virus.\nDo we see a certain common factor here? What elements of leadership are we seeing come under the highlight?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has definitely been redefining leadership around the world.\nWe have joining us live Dr. Ogan Gurel, Chief Medical Officer of Psomagen and Visiting Professor at Solbridge International School of Business.\nDr. Gurel, it's great to have you on the program.\n\n\nMany experts, including yourself, have identified leadership as being the single most important factor in successfully dealing with a pandemic.\nAlthough it may seem obvious, please share with us the reasoning behind this important conclusion.\n\npandemics in general, involving (1) very public efforts where everybody can be affected and (2) often tremendous ambiguity in the situation\nHence leadership - as compared to simply management - is especially critical.\nThe recent history of Korea, in battling SARS and MERS and now Covid-19 represents almost a perfect example of how important leadership is.\nMentioning Dr. Park Seung-cheol\n\nYou mentioned leadership as being different from management. Can you please clarify that distinction some more.\n\nPublic engagement is critical and so a sense that everyone is in together is important\nI will mention the yellow-jackets. It may sound trivial, but actually this sends a powerful message. President Moon was also wearing the yellow jacket\nAnd making decisions in the face of tremendous uncertainty - even now we don't know everything about the virus - requires special qualities that go beyond management.\n\nWhat would you say are the most important among such qualities?\n\n- Urgency\nScientific reasons\nSocial-psychological reasons\n\n- Transparency\nHonest and accurate descriptions of reality\nReporting \"bad news\" is not easy, especially in Korean culture, but good leadership overcame that. For example with the pandemic training exercise in December\nTwice daily reports, delivered reliably, without politicization, with substance and continuous repetition of key points.\n\n- Humility\nAdapting from missteps or potential problems\nExample of Dr. Park Seung-cheol in my class at Sungkyunkwan University\n\n- Calmness or equipoise\n\nPresident Moon, for example, strikes me as being quite calm in the face of tremendous challenges. Some may interpret that as weakness but this sort of equipoise enables one to accurate assess the reality around them.\n\n- The fifth factor - vision - is the most important\nRemember I said that crises, especially pandemics are those in which the information is incomplete. There is tremendous uncertainty and ambiguity.\nUltimately the solution in the face of an uncertain present is to create a more certain future.\nI am reminded of the Wayne Gretzky quote - one of history's greatest hockey players - \"I never skate to the puck, I skate to wear the puck will be.\"\nA leader must imagine the future, provide a vision and a pathway for achieving that.\nPresident Moon, for example, hasn't just been \"managing\" the epidemic, he has been imaging and building for a post-pandemic future. For example with the $170M vaccine initiative launched in April. And also reaching out the world to help provide Korean knowledge and expertise to the WHO and other international organizations\n\nWould you say there have been any mistakes in leadership here in Korea?\n\nI'm glad you asked that question. After all, as I said, outstanding leaders don't just want to hear good news and have a false view of reality. So good leadership will accept criticism very seriously.\nFirst of all, as mentioned, \"mistakes\" are always a part of these situations. Information is incomplete, and circumstances are rapidly changing. Perfection is impossible.\nThat's why continuous learning is key.\nWhen we had the Itaewon outbreak, the leadership quickly realized that because of the vulnerable minority populations involved and the social stigma that might be attached to those clubs, they had to quickly shift to a more anonymous testing system. Which they did.\n\nI would say, however, that there was one key mistake that I believe President Moon and the leadership should be aware of and should change.\nKorea has done an outstanding job dealing with the pandemic - in no small part due to its excellent leadership - and there are now initiatives underway for Korea to provide global leadership, sharing knowledge, sharing expertise, etc. with the wider global community.\n\nIn Korea we call this . It is something to be very proud of President Moon, for example, recently addressed the World Health Assembly in this regard. But the picture was problematic.\nIt should President Moon offering \"Global Leadership\" in front of a mass of South Korean flags.\nIt gives a message not of global partnership but ultranationalistic pride. I don't believe that is the message that President Moon wished to deliver.\nIt probably would make South Korean citizens happy but it is quite strange given that all of us in a global pandemic are trying to overcome these sorts of isolationist, nationalistic tendencies.\nSouth Korea (and President Moon) can surely provide such global leadership but this concept should be kept in mind.\nBut again, I want to emphasize that with respect to this pandemic the leadership in Korea has really been outstanding.\n\nDr. Ogan Gurel, Chief Medical Officer of Psomagen and a medical doctor himself, many thanks as always for your valuable insights. We appreciate it. Hope to see you in the studio next time.\n\nRecently, over the last few years, there have been support of a global leadership trend to an era of \"GZERO\" as opposed to global summit meetings that we are used to, like the G7 or G20.\nIn addition, the U.S. has been losing its power grounds as a superpower state of \"G1.\"\nAre we really looking at a time of GZERO? Is a vacuum of power in international politics emerging?\n\nLooking back to when understanding global leadership was first important as scholars and politicians alike adopted globalization, how has the the world changed? Are we facing another change of era?\n\nWoo Byung-won, Associate Professor of Political Science at Yonsei University, thanks for speaking with us this evening.\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",

How do you see this case unfolding?\n\nWhy did Floyd's death spark such widespread, visceral outrage, while three other deaths of African Americans this year - Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Tony McDade, a black transgender man killed by police officers in Tallahassee - did not?\n\nWould you say the protests are no longer just about George Floyd?\n\nThe protest in New York turned violent as some protesters looted and vandalized stores in the SoHo neighborhood. There are concerns that these violent lootings and vandalism obviously can't be encourage and are of completely different nature from the peaceful protests against George Floyd's death.\n\nThe challenges will surely reverberate through the year and beyond in ways that are impossible at the moment to predict. For Donald Trump, not to mention through November's election.\nHow do you expect the latest protest to impact the upcoming election?\n\nNot only in the U.S., but the tragic incident is sparking reaction from different countries around the world.
