These households will get their payments next Monday in the form of cash deposits to their accounts. Others will have to apply for the relief money on the website of their credit card company and will get it in the form of debit or credit card points.\nIf you plan to apply in person or want to get the funds on a prepaid card or in regional gift certificates, applications will be accepted from the 18th.\nTo keep people from all applying at once, the government will run a 5-day rotation system according to the last digit of one's birth year just like how Korea rationed the buying of face masks.\nThe size of the payments depends on the number of people in the household.\nA household of one person can get roughly 330 U.S. dollars, a family of two about 490 dollars; about 650 for a household of three, and some 820 for a family of four.\nThe specific standards can be checked online.\nHowever, there's limit on how and when the money can be used.\nThe program was initially designed to help local business owners, so it can only be spent in traditional markets, convenience stores and other local mom and pop stores and only in the district where you live.\nThe government hopes all the money will be spent by the end of the August.\nFor those who do not apply, the money will be considered a donation and will be used to support those who've lost their jobs or have been put on unpaid leave.\nChoi Jeong-yoon, Arirang News.\nReporter : jychoi@arirang.com",
