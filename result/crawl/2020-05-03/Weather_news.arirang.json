We recorded the hottest temperatures of the year in Seoul today with highs reaching 28 degrees Celsius and Uljin in Gyeongsanbuk-do a whopping 30. What's in store for us over the weekend?\n\nWell, Conn-young. Today's unseasonably warm weather was close to what we would get in mid-summer. Experts say, our bodies are not acclimated to the heat yet, especially after the lengthy string of cold snaps we were having. So, we should make sure not to catch a cold. Along with the heat, dry weather advisories have been placed in most parts of the country and a wind advisory has been issued in Gangwon-do Province.\n\nThe ridge of high pressure responsible for this early heat wave is crossing the Southwest, but will shift from tonight to Saturday. This will allow highs to drop to the mid-20s. Rain is forecasted for Gangwon-do Province and Jeju Island for the weekend, so please be prepared.\n\nWe'll have cloudy skies tomorrow in most parts of the nation with Seoul, Gwangju and Daegu all starting off at 17 degrees Celsius.\n\nDaytime highs will be 23 degrees in Seoul. Gwangju and Jeju will see light rain showers in the afternoon.\n\nTokyo will see sunny spells and Beijing will experience extreme heat.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
