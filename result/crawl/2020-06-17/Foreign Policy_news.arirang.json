He also claimed Germany is not practicing fair trade with the U.S.\nIn 2014, NATO agreed that each of its 30 members should spend 2% of GDP on defense, but many countries, including Germany, haven't managed this.\nThis could be alarming not just for NATO members, but also for other countries where U.S. forces are based.\nFor example, the U.S. has more than 26,000 troops stationed in South Korea and 55,000 in Japan.\nFor months, Seoul and Washington have been trying to come to an agreement over defense cost sharing but they are at an impasse as Korea's Foreign Ministry proposed a 13% increase, whereas the U.S. demanded a 50% increase during the last renegotiations in March.\n\n\"Considering the U.S. policy for the Pacific and China, the need for a reduction of U.S. troops in Korea is not high. Also, there are ongoing nuclear problems from North Korea. That being said, instead of cutting troops in the region, it's more likely they will pressure South Korea using this method to try to increase Korea's share of the defense costs.\"\n\nIn addition, due to the National Defense Authorization Act, U.S. forces in Korea cannot be reduced without the approval of congress.\nHowever, former U.S. ambassador to Berlin, Richard Grenell recently said President Trump is \"very clear\" in bringing troops home from countries like South Korea, Japan and other allies, which means the reduction of troops is not completely out of the question.\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News.\nReporter : tkim@arirang.com",

Tensions are rising between South Korea and Japan, as contentious historical issues continue to fuel trade and diplomatic disputes between the two neighbors.\nSouth Korea last week decided reopen a complaint filed with the World Trade Organization last year over Tokyo's unilateral export restrictions placed on Korean companies, after a Seoul court ordered Japanese firms to compensate its victims of forced labor during Japan's brutal colonization of Korea in the 1900s.\nBilateral relations have been worsening throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Korea's call for Japan to return to trade talks falling on deaf ears.\nBut will Seoul's latest move prompt Tokyo to return to dialogue and work on settling their dispute?\nWe connect with Nancy SNOW, Distinguished Professor of Public Diplomacy at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies, and Dr. John Nilsson-Wright, Senior Lecturer at the University of Cambridge and Korea Fellow at the Chatham House.\n\nDr. Snow: Seoul has decided to resume its WTO complaint against Japan's export measures. How do you think this will play out will this force Tokyo to return to talks?\n\nDr. Nilsson-Wright: A South Korean court announced last week that it will start liquidating the assets of a Japanese firm that ignored rulings in 2018 to compensate the Korean victim's of Japan's wartime forced labor. Tokyo's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Thursday that Japan will respond to the issue with every option on the table. Could this further escalate the trade war and what kind of measures do you expect Japan to take?\n\nBilateral relations have worsened over the course of the pandemic, and most recently, Japan has shown great displeasure over the expansion of the G7 summit which would include South Korea, Australia, India and Russia. Why do you think the Abe administration is showing such reluctance to improve ties with Seoul?\n\nSome say Prime Minister Abe's recent drop in approval ratings will make the relationship between Korea and Japan more difficult. Do you agree?\n\nWith the current absence of global coordination amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, how critical is it that South Korea and Japan put their differences aside and come together?\n\nHow should the two countries go about mending their relations? What compromises do you think each side should make?\n\nWe'll have to wrap up our discussion here.
