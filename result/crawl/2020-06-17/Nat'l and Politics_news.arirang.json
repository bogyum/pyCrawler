Joining us live is Andrei Lankov, Professor at Koomin University and a North Korea expert trained at Kim Il-sung University in Pyeongyang.\nProfessor Lankov, thanks for linking up with us.\n\n\n\nNorth Korea unleashed a fresh stream of threats and insults today pledging to dismantle the last remnants of President Moon Jae-in's legacy of rapprochement and move troops into disarmed border areas. First of all, if the North were to go ahead with that, it would effectively mean the end of the Moon administration's 2018 reconciliation efforts, would it not?\n\nWe also learned that President Moon had offered to send his national security adviser Chung Eui-yong and national intel service chief Suh Hoon to Pyeongyang as special envoys. Kim Yo-jong \"flatly rejected calling it a tactless and sinister proposal.\" Is dialogue off the table?\n\nThe initial U.S. response was muted, with a senior administration official saying the American government was aware of the North Korean move and that the U.S. was in close coordination with its South Korean allies. How far will the North go if it doesn't draw a satisfactory response from the U.S.?\n\nAndrei Lankov, Professor at Kookmin University and a North Korea expert many thanks for speaking with us this evening. We appreciate it.\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",

We will no longer tolerate any more of North Korea's careless rhetoric, which fundamentally harms the mutual trust between the leaders of the two Koreas.\"\n\nKim Yo-jong called Moon's recent message of cooperation and dialogue between the two sides \"shameless sophistry\" saying it was devoid of responsibility and filled with flowery words.\nThe strong response to that from South Korea's top office likely shows that the Moon administration will not be swayed by Pyeongyang's rhetoric and will not overlook attempts to destroy the spirit of past inter-Korean agreements or damage the trust between the two sides.\n\nThe developments and the speed at which this is unfolding are a shock no doubt for the Moon administration, which had been reaching out to North Korea. The regime also claimed to have rejected South Korea's offer to send a special envoy to Pyeongyang. I understand that was supposed to be a confidential proposal.\n\nYes, the top office expressed regret over the North's choice to unilaterally reveal South Korea's confidential proposal calling it unprecedented and senseless.\nIt said Pyeongyang had deliberately distorted the purpose of the offer and should show basic etiquette.\nThe North's state media claimed that President Moon had \"begged\" it to accept the offer which it flatly rejected.\nSeoul's top office stressed that North Korea's latest actions will not help the regime, and that it will be held responsible for anything that happens as a result.\n\nSeparately today, President Moon held a luncheon with former unification ministers as well as his special advisor for foreign affairs and national security to discuss the current situation.\nAlthough details of the luncheon were not disclosed, Moon likely listened to their opinions and discussed ways to resolve the standoff.\nFor now, options for a turnaround appear limited, and the focus likely to be on managing the situation.\nBack to you, Conn-young.\nReporter : kimmj@arirang.com",

The North should take due responsibility for its actions. We urge the North to stop further exacerbating the situation.\"\n\nHe said the two Koreas had agreed through the September 2018 'Pyeongyang Joint Declaration' to first normalize the Gaeseong Industrial Complex and the Mount Geumgang Tourism Project as conditions improve.\nHe added, Seoul has worked at ways to improve inter-Korean cooperation such as the possibility of individual tours to the North and business visits to Gaeseong Industrial Complex.\nThat's all I have at this hour, back to you Connyoung.\nReporter : yoohong@arirang.com",
