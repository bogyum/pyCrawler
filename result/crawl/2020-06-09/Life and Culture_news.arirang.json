We started the campaign at the airport, but now other private facilities have followed suit voluntarily.\"\n\nSocial distancing is a part of traveling now, so new kinds of activities are trending at hotels.\n\"Smart staycation\" is one such trend, like at this hotel, where guests stay in their rooms and use smart TVs to play content from their smartphones.\n\n(KOREAN- )\n\"Due to COVID-19, we tried to help our customers stay safe and have fun during their trip here, so we've installed smart TVs in each room.\"\n\nThe hotel also offers a private rent-a-car service so that customers can limit their contact with others when they want to go outside.\n\nWith tourism going 'non-contact,' forests have emerged as a new hotspot.\nAnd Jeju has officially designated this \"eco-tourism\" as a new pillar of the industry.\n\n(Stand-up)\n\"Here, instructors used to take visitors around in groups. But those group tours have been cancelled, and now visitors make their own journey based on these recommendations.\"\n\nTo help people clear their minds and relax, the forest service recommends simply walking through the forest, gazing at the sky, recording birdsong and even trying to capture these scenes on paper.\nImmersing oneself in nature, experts say, helps people overcome the 'corona blues.'\n\n(KOREAN- )\n\"There's a lower risk of infection here.
