It's highly possible that he'll be found guilty in the future.\"\n\nProsecutors could still indict Lee after collecting further evidence. But, it's the billionaire business tycoon's own ambitions that may be putting the company at risk.\n\n\"His repeated 'owner risk', the misconduct of conglomerate owners, continues to be a threat to the company's stock prices and its future.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Lee is also dealing with an old bribery case that has been ordered to be retried by the Supreme Court.\nAs prosecutors expressed much disappointment with the court's latest ruling, Samsung now pins its hopes on a citizen panel.\nThe company last week requested an establishment of a panel of citizens to judge if the latest investigation is even necessary.\nIn the meantime, Lee is expected to concentrate all efforts on improving his company's image.\n\n\"We will create the 'New Samsung' that suits South Korea's national dignity.\"\n\nWhile the fate of the giant company relies heavily on its leader's legal fight, Samsung will now speed up its preparations for the future by regaining public trust.\nKim Dami, Arirang News.\nReporter : damikim@arirang.com",

When you invest, you buy low, sell high. So when this kind of crisis happens, share price is down. So they take opportunities.\"\n\nHowever, he emphasized that what's really important is not the timing but to invest for the long-term.\nAnd mobile apps that help customers invest are also seeing a boom. Digital investment management app service AIM has grown roughly 17-fold on-year as more people look to avoid face-to-face contact amid the outbreak.\n\n\"The mobile app systematically manages customers' assets with a set of algorithms very similar to those used by the world's top one percent of institutional investors.\"\n\nAIM's CEO added that more people investing in the stock market is a good trend saying that it is difficult to build wealth just through income from labor alone.\nEum Ji-young Arirang News.\nReporter : jy_rachel@arirang.com",
