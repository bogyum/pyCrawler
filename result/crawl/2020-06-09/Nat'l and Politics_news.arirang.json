You and I, we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together\".\nJay Park, a Korean hip-hop artist, expressed his rage over the killing of George Floyd, and showed support for the global movement.\nHowever, some K-Pop fans say these messages of support have caught them by surprise.\n\n\"K-Pop artists did say something and they did voice support of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was surprising and I wasn't expecting it.\"\n\nFans say it's not about the post itself, but the thoughts and intentions of the artists.\n\n\"And I think just saying anything, anything about this issue is more than welcome and more than enough for a lot of fans, because most of the K-Pop industry right now is just radio silence, right? So just anything like a post is more than enough.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time South Korean artists have been vocal on social issues.\nThrough their songs, K-Pop stars have spoken about female empowerment and climate change.\nAnd, experts say, because of the sheer number of fans around the globe, K-Pop is no longer strictly Korean.\n\n\"Since many South Korean artists have been communicating with fans globally, they are sensitive to global issues. It became very natural to react to such issues, and it is possible to leave messages to fans.\"\n\nIn the meantime, BTS and other South Korean stars have made large donations to the 'Black Lives Matter movement', and continue to call for engagement from their fans on this global issue.\nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.\nReporter : peterwjchoi@gmail.com",
