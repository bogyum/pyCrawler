A scorching heatwave will began to grip the peninsula starting on Friday. Please continue to watch out for wide temperature gaps.\n\nCloudy spells are expected in northern parts of the country, but areas in the south, including Daegu and Busan, will see plenty of sunshine.\n\nDaytime highs for Seoul will be 22 degrees Celsius and Daegu 29.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Beijing will see scorching highs of 32 degrees tomorrow.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
