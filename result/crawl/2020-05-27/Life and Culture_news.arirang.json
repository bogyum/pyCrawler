It's important to link their legacy with a travel course so that tourists feel it's easy to access and can fully experience their historical value.\"\n\nThe first course is the 'Golden Era Route', which centers on Gyeongsangbuk-do Province where Gyeongju, the Silla Kingdom's capital for 1000 years, is located.\nThis course focuses on discovering the spirit of Korea by tracing the history of Buddhism and Confucianism in the country.\nWith the 'Antiquity Route', one can sneak a peek of Korea's ancient culture, religion and arts. Visitors can see fortress sites, ancient tombs and stone pagodas from two thousand years ago.\nThe 'Folk Music Route' visits the homes of traditional music such as Pansori, the epic chant, and Ganggangsullae, a dance where people hold hands in a circle.\nOther courses track the natural wonders of Jeju Island, the royal palaces and structures of the Joseon Dynasty, as well as the Buddhist temples and monasteries hidden in Korea's mountains.\n\n\"All the courses can be done in 3 to 4 days and there's a relatively low risk of infections as cultural heritage sites are outside so people can keep a safe distance.\"\n\nAs well as the courses, regions around Korea are also restarting festivals and events so that people can experience the country's intangible cultural assets in person.\nThese events, which had been postponed due to COVID-19, include performances at royal palaces and fashion shows featuring traditional Korean clothing.\n\nContaining more specific information, a guidebook will be distributed to tourists in four different languages, and a wide range of cultural content will be shared on social media.

They are effective enough to block droplets. It's important that people wash their hands frequently and keep distance from others.\"\n\nAs summer nears in South Korea, the government plans to double the amount of surgical masks produced.\n\n\n\"KF94 masks are highly protective, but they can also make it difficult to breathe. So we recommend dental or surgical masks.\"\n\nIn early June, the government plans to announce its recommended standards for thinner face masks for public use that have the same effectiveness as surgical masks used in hospitals.\nYoon Jung-min, Arirang News.\nReporter : yoonjm@arirang.com",

We are currently discussing the matter with quarantine authorities.\"\n\nTo prepare schools for the second phase of school resumption on Wednesday, quarantine authorities stress that students and teachers need to check their health condition each morning and stay home if they feel sick.\nThey are also asked to avoid visiting multi-use facilities including singing rooms and PC cafes.\nTo lower the risk of infection, the education ministry has advised schools to limit their capacity to two-thirds.\nThis means the students will go to school only on designated days of the week, with elementary schools being required to open at least one day a week.\nHowever, for some schools, back-to-school has been postponed once again.\nSeoul's Gangseo-gu District announced it was postponing school by another week, after a six-year-old kindergartener tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\nOver 450 schools and kindergartens in Seoul, Gyeongsangbuk-do Province and Bucheon also announced similar measures following confirmed cases in their districts.\nKim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.\nReporter : hyosunee88@gmail.com",

Yet they are portrayed very differently as quick and dynamic monsters. Some people even call them \"K-zombies\". Korea's Joseon dynasty also provides unique and attractive visuals.\n\n'Extracurricular' is another \"can't miss\" Korean show.\nThis teen crime drama tells the story of a high school student who has been abandoned by his parents and leads a double life.\nCritics say fans of Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' will enjoy 'extracurricular', which the Los Angeles Times called the \"cream of the crop\" of the Korean dramas produced by Netflix.\n\n\"Of course, director Bong's Oscar-win paved the way for the worldwide audience to pay more attention to Korean content. But a more fundamental reason behind the attention is that streaming services such as Netflix offer an escape from the regulated drama format, freedom from the subject and capital.\"\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Korean dramas, Kim recommends 'Crash Landing on You', a love story set across the divided Korean peninsula.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",

I believe the series could be popular with two directors' own strengths brewed together.\"\n\nThe series has already attracted much attention from the global press.\nThe BBC has praised the series, saying viewers should look no further than this drama to quench their craving for content that tackles issues we are currently facing.\n\n\"The reason why Bong's work is attracting lots of fans is because it deals with the issue of 'class'. Snowpiercer shows how people are worried about dropping down from their current class. It also gives us a warning that conflict between classes and even system destruction could happen if we don't take care of such issues.\"\n\nThe TV series can also go into more depth and offer a more detailed plot that the movie couldn't provide due to the lack of time.\nThe first two episodes are already available on Netflix, and a new episode will be released every week.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\n\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",
