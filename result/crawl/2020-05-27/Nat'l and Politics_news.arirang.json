I told her to stop telling me that because I do have it on.\"\n\n\"I was told to come to school so I came, and I was welcomed by my teachers and friends. It's very different from class online.\"\n\nThese first graders are among some 2.4 million students going back to class, including kindergarteners, third-year middle school students and second-year high school students.\nThe school day has been shortened, so after lunch at their desks, they were dismissed.\n\n\"But some kids weren't able to come to school at all. More than 560 schools nationwide had to delay their opening because there were new infections confirmed in their communities.\"\n\nAn unexpected twist, but the education ministry says classes had to resume eventually.\n\n\"Online classes cannot provide students with the kind of education they get from their teachers in person.\"\n\nTo prevent even the smallest chance of infection, parents can still choose to homeschool their kids.\n\n\"It's important to educate our kids but we are focusing more on creating a safe environment for them.\"\n\nAnd in urban areas like Seoul, schools rotate attendence so they have only two-thirds of their students on site at one time.\nKim Dami, Arirang News.\nReporter : damikim@arirang.com",

            "context": "A mysterious condition that could be linked to COVID-19 has been reported in hundreds of children in several European countries and North America.\nThe World Health Organization put out a scientific brief this past month describing \"clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.\"\nThe new ailment is being called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C and we've seen a growing number of cases spread in more than a dozen countries.\n\n\"We're now starting to see that children who test positive for COVID or test positive for COVID antibodies are developing these inflammatory symptoms. Inflammation of the blood vessel, inflammation of the heart. But it's quite serious. And we've lost a number of children.\"\n\n\"Now very recently there have been some reports of children getting admitted with a strange syndrome, an inflammatory syndrome, something that looks like sepsis, something that looks like Kawasaki's disease causes inflammation in the blood vessels. Now, its not very clear what the links are between COVID-19 and this syndrome. There are some children who tested positive for the virus and some who haven't.\"\n\nThe South Korean CDC reported two suspected cases of MIS-C earlier this week raising concerns as the country went ahead with the second phase reopening of schools today - high school juniors, middle school seniors and first and second graders in elementary school.\n\nSo, what is the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and how worried should we be?\nIt's the topic of our News In-Depth with Dr. Alice Tan, Internist at MizMedi Women's Hospital.\n\nDr. Tan, it's great to have you back on the program.\n\nBefore we delve into the issue of MIS-C, let's briefly touch upon the latest COVID-19 situation in South Korea. Overnight, we've seen new coronavirus cases here peak to 40 - a high we haven't seen in 49 days. This as younger students return to classrooms today. Why do we continue to see new outbreaks?\n\nNow focusing on this mysterious syndrome found in children and teens.\nWe've heard that MIS-C shows Kawasaki-like symptoms, but also toxic shock syndrome.\nWhat is the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children?\n\nWhat are the symptoms doctors are looking or?\n\nWhat is the link between this new syndrome and COVID-19?\n\nThus far, one silver lining from COVID-19 seemed that it didn't affect children as much as it did on adults. But, the emergence of the MIS-C has prompted the medical community to rethink how it looks at COVID-19 and children.\nHow is the medical world approaching this children's disease?\n\nWhat do we know so far about MIS-C? What is the most critical element that needs to be tackled in order to get control of this disease from spreading?\n\nHow have other countries in Europe and the U.S. been dealing with MIS-C?\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo just last week said it's too early and scientists still don't understand enough about the coronavirus to say whether New York public schools will reopen in the fall as he expressed specific concern over MIS-C, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says could be caused by COVID-19\n\n\"Today there are 13 countries and 25 states. This is one of those situations where the more they look, I believe, the more they're going to find. So when we're talking about schools, again, the facts have changed from the quote-unquote experts because there are no experts on this COVID virus.\"\n\nLower grade school students returned to school today. We keep coming back to this question, but with two suspected cases of MIS-C in South Korea, one under the age of 10 and the other in their teens, should we be worried about sending out kids back to school?\n\nLast but not least, what are some disease-control measures that parents and teachers should take especially as they manage lower age children?\n\nDr. Alice Tan, our go-to medical expert here on our Arirang News In-Depth, thank you as always for your insights this evening. We appreciate it.\n\n\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",
