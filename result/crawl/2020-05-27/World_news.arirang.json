What is Xi Jinping attempting to do ultimately?\n\nThe U.S. has said it would slap China with sanctions should Beijing move ahead with the implementation of this law. What does China's such move mean for the U.S., really?\n\nFor many months, China watchers have been they were not overruling the Hong Kong authorities. Now, they are cracking down.

Every year, they've achieved that target, and often, a fair bit more.\nFriday, Chinese Premier Li announced that they have not set a specific target for economic growth.\nAn indicator of great uncertainty, why have they not set a growth target, and what does it mean for the world's second-largest economy?\n\nRising tensions between the United States and China are spilling over into the airline industry.\nWashington has accused Beijing of blocking American carriers from resuming flights to China, prompting U.S. authorities to more heavily scrutinize Chinese airlines.\nWhat can you tell us about this?\n\nChina is also demanding that the U.S. withdraw sanctions on tech suppliers. So, the spillover effect from the U.S., China tensions is rather extensive. Is the world ready for for the two superpowers to go head to head?\n\nWhat is your forecast on the Hong Kong issue?
