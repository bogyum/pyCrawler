China has replaced its promised formula of one country, two systems with one country, one system.\"\n\nU.S. policy exemptions on Hong Kong, enacted in 1992, give the territory benefits in terms of tariffs, investment, trade and visas, which are some of the factors that have promoted Hong Kong as a financial hub and from which mainland China has also benefitted.\nReporter : jiyeonkim@arirang.co.kr",
