They said people have the right to be respected, and they will stand together.\nAn expert says these acts by K-pop artists have strengthened their fans support for the movement.\n\n\"With BTS sharing this message, even if it's something we take for granted, such as opposing racial discrimination, K-pop fans can feel encouraged, and feel like they're being supported.
