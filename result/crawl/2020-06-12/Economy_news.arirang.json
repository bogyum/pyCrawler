To achieve a stable financial market and credit flow, we should use other policies as well as the rate policy, if needed.\"\n\nThe chief also said the coronavirus challenge made the bank think about its fundamental role in the economy.\nHe said the health crisis has brought the central bank a heavier responsibility than at any other time, because of its impact on the economy right now as well as the changes it will bring to the economy after the pandemic.\nLee said the authorities are currently discussing the extent to which the bank's role can be expanded, saying some people view the central bank as a 'crisis fighter'.\n\nThe governor added that the bank will work on research and development for a post-coronavirus inflation targeting system, as well as a central bank digital currency.\nLee said the health crisis will bring changes to the future economic structure, including digitalization.\nHe warned against possible economic polarization caused by the digital economy, emphasizing the need to prepare for a post-pandemic era led by the private sector.\nYoon Jung-min, Arirang News.\nReporter : yoonjm@arirang.com",
