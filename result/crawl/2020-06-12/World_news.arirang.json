There was hope something concrete could come of it.\nTwo years later, where are we on this two year anniversary? North Korea today said two years of diplomacy with President Trump had \"faded away into a dark nightmare.\"\n\nIt definitely appears North Korea is more interested in getting the U.S.' attention than Washington is of Pyeongyang's. We've been seeing North Korea ramp up its aggressive rhetoric toward South Korea, yes, but also the U.S. dripping with anti-Washington remarks.\nIs North Korea fed up with not being at the top of Washington's agenda especially faced with persistent U.S.-led sanctions?\n\nHow relevant is North Korea in the U.S. election cycle? Is Pyeongyang's threat to pressure Washington ahead of the upcoming election a \"threat\" enough to prompt a solid enough reaction/response from Washington?\n\nWhat's next? What do you expect from Pyeongyang in the next couple of weeks and months? Do we expect bigger provocations from North Korea? How will U.S. election results shape Washington, Pyeongyang relations?\n\nSean King, VP of Park Strategies and an Asian Affairs Scholar, many thanks as always for speaking to us this evening. We appreciate it.\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",
