During the COVID-19 outbreak, a significant number of people avoided crowded areas when compared to MERS in 2015.\nIn addition, people have been twice as likely to practice social distancing during COVID-19.\nAs for personal hygiene practices, there has been a striking difference.\nDuring MERS, 15.five-percent of the respondents said they wore facial protection. In 2020, that figure is at 80-percent and there's a 20-percent increase in hand-washing frequency.\nThe doctor who conducted the survey explains what this means for today's response to COVID-19.\n\n\"We are protecting ourselves from the virus as well as stopping it from spreading. This is the most efficient way to protect yourself, your family, and the communityespecially when there is no cure or vaccine.\"\n\nSouth Koreans were fearful during the MERS outbreak due to its high fatality rate. The disease infected one-hundred-86 people nationwide, and caused three-hundred-78 deaths.\n\nThe doctor added that a possible explanation for the increase in preventive behavior this time around is due to the public\u2019s previous experience of emerging infectious disease epidemics including MERS.\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News\nReporter : tkim@arirang.com",

We also explore how Korea should move forward.\nToday we have Dr. Lee Ju-ho who served as South Korea's Minister of Education, Science and Technology from 2010 to 2013, and established one of the most innovative institutions in the country during his term. He is now a professor and economist at the Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management. Also joining us is Dr. Stephen EZELL, Director of Global Innovation Policy and Vice President of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n1. To both: Last month, Nature Index highlighted South Korea's leadership in global innovation. Which unique factors enabled South Korea to become a fast follower in science and technology today?\n\n2. Dr. Lee: South Korea has been lagging behind in basic research, but as minister you tried to change that by establishing the Institute of Basic Science. This institute made headlines this year when researchers completed the world's first high-resolution genetic map. What are the factors that enabled it to achieve such a feat, and what more should be done to encourage progress?\n\n3. Dr. Ezell: Learning from the U.S. experience, what kind of regulatory principles or improvements do you think are needed for South Korea to become an innovation powerhouse in emerging technologies?\n\n4. Minister Lee: South Korea spends the second highest proportion of GDP on R&D after Israel, yet its level of innovation in emerging technologies is not exactly proportionate to the input, ranking 11th on the WIPO Innovation Index.\nTo become a first mover in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, what kind of policy direction should the country adopt?\n\n5. Dr. Ezell: Which industries or technologies do you think South Korea could lead the world in, and how should it handle growing competition from China?\n\n6. Dr. Lee: South Korea's New Deal is about bolstering a digital economy based on remote services in health and education. What opportunities do you see for Korea in terms of education technology?\n\nThis is where we have to wrap up the discussion. Dr. Lee Ju-ho South Korea's Minister of Education, Science and Technology from 2010 to 2013, and professor at the KDI School of Public Policy. And Stephen EZELL, Vice President of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Thank you for joining the program\n\n\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",

            "context": "Global demand for South Korea's medical products exploded in the month of May, amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nExports of bio-health products including COVID-19 test kits surged 59 per cent on year, and PPE saw a whopping 124-thousand percent increase.\nSome say this marks the start of K-Bio beyond COVID-19, with many now watching for developments toward a Korean-made vaccine and treatment.\nToday, we have our tech correspondent Oh Soo-young to discuss the issue with us.\nSooyoung, the government finally gave us the answer that we were waiting to hear. An idea of when a vaccine will be out to end this pandemic. How does the timeline look and can we be optimistic?\nRight, the government's task force on COVID-19 drugs told us Wednesday that three types of treatments for the coronavirus would be out by this year and a vaccine by 2021.\nThe government is planning to inject eighty-two million U.S. dollars of its supplementary budget into achieving its targets.\nAnd it seems we do have reason to be optimistic.\nThe International Vaccine Institute's research center based here in Seoul said on Thursday that it will begin the first and second clinical trials of a vaccine candidate by the end of this month.\nThe institute has been working with Seoul National University Hospital, and their clincial trial's will mark the country's first for the COVID-19. But, there's more to come\nRight now, there are about 20 Korean bio firms working on treatments and vaccines. The largest companies include SK Bioscience and Genexine which are expected to enter clinical trials by next year.\nAs for developing treatments, Celltrion said last week that its animal testing has seen progress in effectively reducing viral loads of the disease, and it plans to start in-human clinical trials from late July. GC Pharma\u2019s plasma treatment is also set to start clinical tests next month.\nSo from the way things are going at the moment, it looks like the development of these drugs is likely to be on schedule.\n\nI mean, SK last month got 3.6 million dollars in R&D funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, so it seems a Korean-made vaccine is worth betting on.\nYes, you're right And there certainly is worldwide attention on Korea's bio technology if the country's test kits are anything to go by.\nKorean firms have exported about 56 million test kits to 110 countries as of late May.\nSouth Korea was able to ramp up its capacity to manufacture test kits very quickly due to the rapid government response and the agility of local firms.\nIn January, there were only four confirmed cases in the country but health officials quickly activated an emergency use approval system that was first adopted in 2015 during the MERS outbreak.\nThis allowed medical companies to develop the test kits and get approval by the first week of February and the rest is history.\nSo we can expect this kind of fast, and effective development for a vaccine as well?\nI would say so. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has streamlined the time-consuming review and approval process. Normally, this takes about 30 days. BUT the period will be accelerated to below 7 days for existing substances being repurposed, and below 15 days for new substances to treat or cure COVID-19.\nThis kind of fast regulatory response has been met with optimism.\n\"I think what South Korea has demonstrated is that it's managed to implement policies quickly in a way to us that makes sense. I think that's a positive sign that Korea is in a good position to develop biomedical technology broadly and also in pharmaceuticals like vaccines.\"\n\nGiven the growing appeal of Korea's bio sector or as some say, K-Bio President Moon Jae-in designated it as one of Korea's three new growth engines. What's the plan?\nThe government's goal is to triple the country's share of new medicine and health devices\nin the global market by 2030 to 6 percent, amounting to about 50 billion dollars in exports.\nThis would hopefully create more than one.one million jobs.\nRight now, Korea is doing fairly well. In terms of biopharmaceuticals, its production capacity is second to the U.S. Also, Korea is producing the third highest number of patents related to bio-pharmaceuticals in the world and patents are usually a good indicator of innovation.\nBut there is some catching up to do as the level of Korea's bio-health technology is estimated to be 78 percent of America's.\n\"There are huge commercial opportunities as the world moves towards digitalized and personalized health care. Korea can leverage medical data, artificial intelligence and its cutting edge digital infrastructure to move ahead especially with smart health care devices. However, start-ups and researchers will need consistent and sufficient support to overcome the long and expensive development process.\"\nWell, this has been a great discussion. It looks like a promising field, although there are of course challenges that lie ahead. Thanks for coming in today Sooyoung.\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",
