On top of that, the UV ray index is soaring.\n\nRight, Conn-young. It\u2019s only the beginning of June, but the temperatures are almost like mid-summer. The first heatwave advisories of the year have been issued in parts of the Gyeongsang-do provinces, and this morning those were expanded to Jeollanam-do province. Heatwave advisories mean people should take precautions for their health, especially at-risk groups like kids and senior citizens. So please make sure to stay hydrated at all times.\n\nFor tomorrow, dense fog is likely to develop along the west coast, so please be extra careful out on the roads. The UV ray index will continue to stay at \u2018very high\u2019 levels all across the nation, so do wear plenty of sunblock as well.\n\nWe\u2019ll start off with sunny spells with Seoul at 18 degrees and Daegu 21.\n\nDaytime highs will hover between 26 and 32 degrees. Daegu will be sweltering hot at 34 degrees.\n\nThe heat in the southern region will ease for the weekend, but in the west, temperatures will rise back up starting on Saturday.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, both Tokyo and Beijing will also see very high levels of UV rays.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
