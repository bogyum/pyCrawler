How does the average person deal with pandemic era anxiety? How can common people assess themselves in terms of addressing any psychological discomfort and what to do?\n\nWhile experts like yourself say it is a normal part of the human response to major emergencies to feel this way, there are times when you do need to reach out for help. How do you know when it's time to seek help? Whether you're suffering PTSD or not?\n\nIt's particularly hard on those already living with conditions like anxiety, depression and OCD. How can people with existing conditions like such deal with a pandemic like COVID-19?\n\nIn a move that would have been unthinkable just months ago, quarantine and social distancing have now become commonplace globally as governments make concerted efforts to fight the spiraling coronavirus outbreak.\nAlthough staying at home and social distancing are proving to be effective in containing the spread of the virus, it's definitely taking a toll on people's psychological health.\nMany say they're feeling lonely, suffering depression. Human beings are a social species that relies on cooperation to survive and thrive. We can no longer socialize as much as we'd like to or used to.\nWhat are your recommendations?\n\nLet's look to overseas for other examples.\nOver in New Zealand, there has been no new reported case of the coronavirus for the 13th day and currently has just one active case.\nThe island nation is now moving to cope with the psychological effects the pandemic has had on its population.\nLive on skype with us is Professor Sir Peter Gluckman, the inaugural Chief Science Advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand from 2009 to 2018.\nThank you for joining us.\n\nAs a trained medical doctor, what psychological impact from COVID-19 are you seeing from your population, Sir Peter Gluckman?\n\nThen, how do you think a national trauma of such size and volume should be dealt with? How does New Zealand plan to cope with it?\n\nDo you believe the severe lockdown that your country imposed has had a mental impact on the people?\n\nProfessor Sir Peter Gluckman, the inaugural Chief Science Advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, many thanks for your insights. We appreciate it.\n\nHow does quarantine take a toll on the mental wellness of those who have been confirmed with the virus? with COVID-19? Looking at the past, we saw a surge in PTSD patients after MERS. How did we deal with them?\n\nHow do you think COVID-19 will impact counseling, and also people's perspectives of approaching counseling?\n\nPark Soyoung, counselor and psychologist at semicolon psychotherapy and counseling center, thank you for speaking with us tonight.
