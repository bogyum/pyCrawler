We could talk about globalization from our point of view. We can agree with other countries that China should abide by the international economic order, but we can express a different opinion on excluding China for no reason.\"\n\nThe U.S. chairs the G7 this year, and President Trump invited President Moon to the meeting when they spoke on the phone on Monday.\nThe G7 has been delayed until at least September, but the specific dates have not been confirmed.\nOh Jung-hee, Arirang News.\nReporter : jhlucyoh@arirang.com",
