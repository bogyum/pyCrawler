Does this mark a shift to a powerful central government and would this be good or bad for society?\n\nKatherine Barbieri: Before the pandemic, there were concerns over growing authoritarianism fueled by populism around the world. Is there a danger of that big government could further ramp up support for strongman leaders?\n\nJeremy Kaplan: Also, there are privacy concerns. Governments are using a combination of location data, video camera footage and credit card records to track citizens.\nWhat are the dangers of contact tracing leading to misuse and end up breaching public trust? Police in Minnesota say they've started contact-tracing demonstrators they arrested during the George Floyd protests.\n\nKatherine Barbieri: For some governments, could this be the perfect excuse for expanding the surveillance apparatus?\n\nTo both: What kind of regulations or ethical guidelines should be put in place to balance the need for tech and data for the public good versus protecting people's privacy?\n\nJeremy Kaplan: What can governments do to utilize or invest in tech infrastructure to protect citizens and their privacy from hacking, cyberthreats, etc.?\n\nTo both: Some say this could be a chance for the government to establish a new normal, as they bail out massive corporations. What do you think should be done to make companies seek broader societal objectives and provide better social safety nets?\n\nThis is where we'll have to wrap up the discussion.

After seven-hundred arrests, eight-thousand officers enforced the city's 8 PM curfew.\n\n\"New York City was looted.

They did not do that in New York City last night.\"\n\nLast night, police officers themselves were being targeted.\nIn St. Louis, over night, several were shot as elsewhere, peaceful marchers took to the streets again trying to relcaim their voices and the narrative.\nAfter a week of protests chaos boiling over as one side of the police line demands order and the other justice - it's the topic of our News In-Depth tonight\n\nFirst, let's go to New York City for the latest. Mike Hale with the New York Times joins us live via Skype.\n\nMike, thanks for linking up with us.\nTell us. What are you seeing as you wake up to the ninth day of protests over George Floyd's death?\n\nBut, most of these protests have largely been peaceful laying down on bridges taking a knee chanting, marching. So, what is it that Americans want? What will it take for these protests to come to an end?\n\nDo you think this rage across the country will impact the race for the White House come November?\nIn other words, will Americans consider certain values as being more important now when they head to the polling booths?\n\nThe protests come as the U.S. struggles with the COVID-19 outbreak. Is covid spreading along with the protests? Are there concerns?\n\nMike Hale, critic for the New York Times, many thanks for linking up with us at such an early hour there in the east coast. Stay safe, Mike.\n\nAnd live in the studio for some analysis of the situation is Mason Richey, Associate Professor of International Politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\nMason, welcome back to the program.\n\nIt seems the protest over the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd is only growing in size and in intensity across the United States. Now in its second week, what, in your view, is fueling more anger?\n\nThis \"face-down hold\" means of immobilization technnique that police officers use is not an issue only in the U.S. It's a method criticized around the world and those cases are being brought back into light.\nDeemed dangerous, all forms of chokeholds are being scrutizined around the world.\nDo you think it's about time that lawmakers acts on banning this approach altogether?\n\nWhat will the protests mean to President Donald Trump in November?\n\nNow, what about for Joe Biden as he inches closer to clinching the Democratic nomination?\nIn the first public speech in weeks, he slammed the president's response to the protests saying President Trump is fanning the (quote) \"flames of hate\" and that America lacks leadership during this time.\nDo Americans see Biden as the leader that they lack at this moment?\n\nAdding to the distrust developed from the kind of leadership Trump showed with the COVID-19 break out, more people seem to be anxious about Trump taking on a second term.\nBut what we hear and assume isn't what we always see at the polls.\nWhy is that?\n\nAmerica for generations has presented itself as this shining 'city upon a hill', the exceptional, wonderful experiment, the melting pot, the likes of which other countries should try and imitate. That moral authority has been on the wane over the last few years.\nIs America losing its appeal? Is this the end of the American Dream?\n\nHopefully these international protests over the death of Mr. George Floyd will force leaders in America to do some serious soul-searching before it's too late.\nMason Richey, Associate Professor of International Politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, many thanks as always for your insights.
