But, for the medical workers, it brings about its own complications.\n\n\"It's hard when neighbors come and ask us which house we are visiting for testing, obviously we can't tell them. Also, most people want to keep things a secret so they ask us to get changed in areas that are out of site like on the stairs in apartment blocks.\"\n\nWith this extensive quarantine system, people arriving into the country are completely segregated from the moment they arrive to when they enter their homes.\nLee Kyung-eun, Arirang News, Daegu.\nReporter : kelee@arirang.com",
