Korea policy, which of course has paid off with three critical summits. The president therefore was a uniquely important catalyst in getting the Americans and the North Koreans together. I think he's shown not only political courage but a shrewd degree of political psychology\"\n\nRecently Moon has extended his initiative for peace and cooperation amid the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\"We've seen also of course some high profile cases of foreign leaders explicitly trying to learn the lessons from the S. Korean experience or in some cases the Irish taoisaech has sought and received technical assistance from S. Korea, countries around the world or state governments, the governor of Maryland and the U.S. strikingly receiving PPE, important equipment from S. Korea..\"\n\nThis has boosted the South Korean leader's status, giving him room to further extend Korea's positive contribution to the world.\n\n\"It's really riding the wave with BTS, with Hallyu, with director Bong Jun-ho and Parasite. There's a lot of goodwill towards S. Korea. So it does have this opportunity to be a beacon in NE Asia of democracy, positive responses to global pandemics, to diplomacy, to goodwill among nations and towards its own citizens.\"\n\nMoon Jae-in on Sunday vowed to turn the COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity so that South Korea can take a leading role in the world.\nOh Soo-young, Arirang News.\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",

But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.\n\nCiting BND, Germany's federal intelligence service, German media reports that there are suspicions the WHO's decision to delay the pandemic declaration was caused by pressure from Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nThe report says Xi called for a meeting with the WHO chief on January 21st, and asked for the pandemic warning to be delayed.\nEven when South Korea saw its first infection on January 20th, followed by the U.S.'s first infection the following day, the WHO did not declare a global pandemic, a decision the BND estimates resulted in the loss of four to six weeks in the fight against COVID-19.\nThe WHO released a statement, calling the allegations \"unfounded and untrue\", adding the WHO chief and President Xi did not speak on January 21st, nor have they ever spoken by phone.\nThe WHO continued to say China confirmed human-to-human transmission to the UN health agency on January 20th, and that the agency \"publicly declared\" two days later that such transmission was taking place in Wuhan.\nThe statements also come as President Trump has blasted China for holding back critical information about the virus, including its failure to accurately report on the number of cases.\nLee Seung-jae, Arirang News.\nReporter : seungjae86@gmail.com",
