Fine dust levels have surged to 'very bad' levels in Seoul and in other areas too. What can you tell us about that?\n\nRight, Conn-young. Due to the steady influx of dust particles from overseas, fine dust concentration levels are sky-rocketing. Those levels are standing at 'very bad' in the Seoul metropolitan area and so an advisory has been issued in the capital and in Gangwon-do Province. Level 'bad' is being observed in parts of Chungcheong-do Province and other parts of Gangwon-do Province. So for those planning to head out, please make sure to wear a mask.\n\nRain is in forecast starting from late tonight in some central regions, as well as in parts of Jeollabuk-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do provinces. The amount of rain will be less than 5 millimeters.\n\nCentral parts of the nation will have cooler spells tomorrow, while southern regions will be mild. Seoul will be 12 degrees Celsius and Busan 16.\n\nDaytime temperatures will be 1 to 4 degrees lower than today's. Seoul will reach up to 20 degrees, Busan 22.\n\nWe'll be able to escape any sweltering heat for this week as rain is in forecast across South Korea for Friday and Saturday.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
