Felt, the main fabric used to make isolation gowns is in short supply as much of it has been used to make face masks. To find a solution, New York called the Korea Dyeing and Finishing Technology Institute, or DYTECH for help.\n\n\"This new material is durable and long-lasting. Protective suits made of felt tear easily and can be used only once whereas this novel material can be washed and reused. Amid the shortage of products due to the pandemic, this could be a groundbreaking invention.\"\n\nGoing through pressure and penetration tests, the fabric is more water-resistant than any other product on site. The core technology is the coating, which stops blood or droplets from entering the suit.\n\nDeveloping the new material and sending samples to the U.S. took less than a week.\nAs the virus has stopped people from holding face-to-face meetings, the deal to export some 500 thousand yards of fabric was made online.\n\n\"We already had the database of different suit restrictions by country. With the accumulated information we could make a fabric that met U.S. standards and have it tested with a simulation system.\"\n\nNegotiations are ongoing over exporting some 10 million yards of the fabric to ten countries. That's enough fabric to make 5 million suits. In order to meet the tremendous number of orders, DYTECH is planning to work with a dozen local businesses to deliver the suits in time. The institute says the COVID-19 crisis has become an opportunity for the domestic fabric industry.\n\n\"The institute aims to boost Korea\u2019s overall textile industry by working with local sewing businesses to make complete protective suits. This is expected to lead to profits over 250 million U.S dollars. Choi Jeong-yoon, Arirang News, Daegu.\"\nReporter : jychoi@arirang.com",

Korean stocks closed lower today, but the Kospi briefly touched the 19-60 mark for the first time in two months. What's the story today in the Korean markets?\n\nFrom today, the Korean central government is accepting applications for the coronavirus relief payments for individual households. Already, local governments have been making smaller payments like this, which it's said has helped local economies. Do you think the nationwide relief payments will have that effect?\n\nIn the coming days we'll have numbers from the Korea Development Institute, also the Bank of Korea reporting on the financial markets.
