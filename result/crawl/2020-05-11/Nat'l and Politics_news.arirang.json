Won-jong, are you at one of the clubs linked to the latest cluster infection?\n\nConn-young, right now I am standing in front of one of the clubs that a 29-year-old COVID-19 patient visited last Friday. As you can see behind me, there is a sign on the door, saying the place is currently closed due to the recent cluster infections.\n\nAs of Monday, the Central Disease Control Headquarters said that the total number of COVID-19 cases in connection with Itaewon clubs is now at 86. But an official said nearly 35% of all total cases are asymptomatic.\nJust in Seoul today, there are 21 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, which brings the total connected with Itaewon to 51.\nThe streets are mostly empty right now. I talked to the owner from one of the restaurants here. He said that they usually get more than a hundred customers per day, but after the cluster infection at the nearby clubs, there has been a drop of almost 80-percent.\n\nWonjong, the mayor of Seoul has been pleading with clubgoers to be tested promising that personal information would be protected and warning that people caught evading testing could be fined.\nWhat's it like there at the Yongsan-gu District office health center? We've been hearing that several thousand still need to be tested.\n\nWe visited Yongsan-gu District office on the way here, where we saw a long line of people who are getting ready to be tested. We met two college students from Denmark and one explained why they came to get tested today.\n\n\"So the whole school doesn't get infected because we are living in dorms. We are in contact with many people everyday.\"\n\nYongsan-gu office officials said on the phone today,more than 7-hundred people came to get tested over the last weekend. However, health authorities are still worried that more than 3-thousand people, who may have been exposed to the virus in Itaewon, are not coming forward for testing.\nSeoul Mayor, Park Won-soon, said Monday that the city will provide free, anonymous testing but in the meantime, health authorities are continuing to urge people to get tested at local health centers right away.\nChoi Won-jong, reporting live from Itaewon, Seoul. Back to you, Conn-young.\n\nThanks, Wonjong. Great job.\nReporter : peterwjchoi@gmail.com",

We will create future growth engines by fostering three new growth industries system semiconductors, biohealth and future cars more vigorously.\n\nPointing out the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis, Moon also plans to improve the country's social safety net by opening an era of universal employment insurance which everyone can benefit from.\nHe also laid out plans to bolster the country's health care system in preparation of a second wave of the outbreak.\nMoon said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been the COVID-19 control tower will be upgraded to the Disease Control and Prevention Administration to strengthen its expertise and independence, while he asked for parliamentary cooperation to establish a system for two vice ministers within the health ministry.\n\nWe will significantly enhance our public healthcare system and ability to respond to infectious diseases to build a safer country. These tasks are very urgent if we are to prepare for the second epidemic wave that experts predict will hit this fall or winter.\n\nWhile vowing to take the lead in an international order of solidarity and cooperation, Moon also expressed hope that Seoul and Pyeongyang can move toward a single community of life and peace although he did not elaborate.\n\nMoon said that for the remainder of his term, he will be devoted to overcoming the national crisis along with the people.

Korean Peninsula Peace Process remains a key pillar of President Moon's policy goals.\n\nCOVID-19 came as a blessing in disguise as President Moon's approval ratings have soared past 70-percent again. This is usually when a South Korean president granted only with a single five year term is hit with a lame duck. What are some key leadership factors that have worked in favor for President Moon?\n\nPresident Moon recently recorded a 71 percent approval rate which is the highest for any president entering their third year in office. Do you think his North Korea policy contributed at all to his 70-plus percent approval rating at this point in office?\n\nIn the remaining two years in office and as he treads unchartered post-COVID-19 waters, what is President Moon's plan going forward in terms of state affairs as well as overcoming the economy?\n\nWhat about on the Korean Peninsua Peace Process front? Obviously, as the president mentioned during his speech yesterday, not only North Korea, U.S. talks, but inter-Korean talks remain at a standstill with absolutely no response from Pyeongyang on whatsoever.\nIs President Moon going to pursue his key policy goal and push forward with inter-Korean cooperation projects and how will he be doing that?\n\nIn the two remaining years of President Moon's presidency, which areas would you like to see this administration prioritize?\n\nHow should the Moon Jae-in administration go about in terms of its North Korea policy as well as handling diplomatic relations with the U.S. and neighboring countries for the remainder of its term?\n\nWhich factors will determine the success or failure of President Moon's presidency at the end of his term in two years' time?\n\nHow do you expect President Moon Jae-in and his presidency will be remembered?\n\nGo Myong-hyun, Research fellow at the Asan Inistute for Policy Studies to my right and Joseph Yi, Associate Professor of Political Sciene at Hanyang University, many thanks as always for speaking with us tonight.
