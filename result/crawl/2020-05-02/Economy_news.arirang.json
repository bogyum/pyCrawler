The extent of the contraction and recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the success of the containment measures.\"\n\nAgainst such a background, the ECB Governing Council decided Thursday to leave key interest rates for the euro area unchanged while it introduced a set of new measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIts Governing Council said the eurozone base interest rate will remain at zero percent, with the marginal lending and deposit rates remaining at a quarter of a percent and minus zero.five percent, respectively.\n\n\"We decided to keep the key ECB interest rate unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converged to a level sufficiently close to, but below 2% within our projection horizon and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.\"\n\nThe ECB also explained it will further ease conditions on the targeted longer-term refinancing operations in order to support liquidity.\nThese measures add to the central bank's comprehensive response to the pandemic, which mainly includes a 820 billion dollar pandemic emergency purchase program announced in mid-March.\nItaly, one of the hardest hit nations in Europe, witnessed its GDP drop by 4.8 percent on-year in the first quarter of the year.\nIts statistics agency also said it fell 4.7 percent compared to the last quarter of 2019.\nThis was the biggest drop since current statistical records began in 1995.\nMeanwhile, finance ministers from the G7 countries held a video conference on Thursday to discuss strategies to accelerate economic activity once they reopen following sweeping lockdowns aimed at containing the pandemic.\nThey agreed to continue coordinating (quote) \"timely and effective actions\" in response to the economic fallout.\nKim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.\n\nReporter : hyosunee88@gmail.com",

But there are concerns this displacement might be permanent for some workers especially those employed in sectors where businesses increasingly rely on technology over the course of the pandemic. Which workers are going to bethe most affected and see major changes after the pandemic?\n\nDr. Schmillan: Of course, we can't forget the 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy who face an immediate threat to their livelihoods. What are the biggest challenges governments will have to work through to provide them sufficient support?\n\nDr. Schmillan: There's been an explosion of job losses in the U.S., as the number of applicants for unemployment benefits saw a 31-fold increase, but in South Korea, there was a 45 percent increase. Some say the disparity is due to employment laws in the U.S. making it easier to dismiss workers than in countries like South Korea where it's relatively difficult to do so. In any case, it's a trade off between job protection and labor demand. How do you think governments should balance this equation throughout the pandemic?\n\nTo both: This crisis has shed light on how much we rely on our monthly paychecks, prompting discussion on universal income. Is this something governments or even big tech companies should be giving serious thought to?\n\nTo Dr. Schmillan: What fundamental improvements for workers do you hope to see once the pandemic is over? And for those who may not get their jobs back straight away, or even have to switch industries, what should be done to support them beyond employment benefits and tax waivers?\n\nTo Dr. Kim: Looking forward, there's also optimism that new businesses will crop up during the crisis, meaning new job opportunities. What's your view?\n\nThat's all we have time for today.
