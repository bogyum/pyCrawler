What's the weather outlook for the weekend?\n\nRight, Conn-young. Heatwave advisories have been in place for a second consecutive day in the south. But these advisories will be lifted tomorrow as cool, easterly winds will bring down the daytime highs. However, in the capital, temperatures will be higher than today\u2019s but there may be sporadic showers in some inland areas in the afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, UV rays will ease compared to yesterday's, but the index is still showing 'very high' levels for most of the nation. So please make sure to wear plenty of sunblock if you have plans to head out.\n\nTomorrow, Seoul, Daegu and Busan will start off at 19 degrees Celsius.\n\nIn the daytime, Seoul will see sweltering highs of 31 degrees. Daegu will be much cooler than today at 28 degrees.\n\nOn Sunday, cloudy spells are expected in the capital and daytime highs will hover around 30 degrees. We may see another bout of rain in the middle of next week.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Tokyo will see rainy spells tomorrow.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
