Back in 2011, his film 'Green Days' was also shown at Annecy.\nHe says he is delighted by this year's invitation as it lets him and his staff know that foreign audiences could be interested in an animated adaptation of a Korean novel.\nAhn also highlights the soundtrack to 'The Shaman Sorceress' as something worth paying attention to.\n\n\"I realized how Korean traditional instruments such as 'janggu' a double-headed drum could lead the sequence on their own. I think it could be considered a great success if foreign audiences get interested in Korean instruments and music aside from K-pop through this animation.\"\n\n'The Shaman Sorceress' has actually been recognized at the festival before, as a work in progress in 2016. At that time, Ahn shared his work process and presented traditional Korean instruments.\nHe believes this animation has received extra attention because it was made through 'teamwork production'.\n\n\"Although animation is a cooperative work, it is mostly considered as a director's personal work in Asia. This time, at the early stage, a lot of people including foreign staff participated in the work, for example when designing characters.\"\n\nThis year's Annecy festival will be held online in June, and along with 'The Shaman Sorceress', South Korean horror-thriller 'Beauty Water' will compete at the festival.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",
