We don't know when our daily lives will crash if cluster infections occur in populated areas where many people move around.\"\n\nAccording to health authorities, eight-hundred-25 newly confirmed cases were reported in the one-month period after the government decided to ease social distancing measures.\nNumbers frequently spiked due to cluster infections in the capital area and the number of cases rose by around 30 percent compared to the previous month.\nAfter the cluster infections in Itaewon nightclubs and the Coupang logistics center in Bucheon, more cases began to arise in other places.\nParticularly in Gyeonggi-do and Incheon, where mass infections stemmed from churches and as the result of a Richway seminar attendee testing positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\nThe total number of cases related to Richway, a door-to-door sales company, has now reached 29.\nA major concern is that many of those cases related to Richway are over the age of 60.\nHealth authorities say there is the possibility of strengthening social distancing measures again if things aren't under control within the next week.\n39 new cases were reported in South Korea on Friday with no additional deaths.\nThe total number of confirmed cases stands at 11-thousand and 668 and 273 deaths.\nJang Tae-hyun, Arirang News\nReporter : tommyjang@arirang.com",
