This is the only path to a world free of COVID-19. But this will require the most massive public health effort in history.\"\n\nThe Director General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros, welcomed the funds but said the results should be equally distributed.\n\n\n\"The ultimate measure of success will not be how fast we can develop tools. It will be how equally we can distribute them. None of us can accept a world in which some people are protected while others remain exposed.\"\n\nHe also said that this is an opportunity not only to defeat a common enemy but to forge a common future.\nEum Ji-young Arirang News.\nReporter : jy_rachel@arirang.com",
