Until COVID-19 is completely beaten, our managers will instruct the players to put everything into their training and into the game rather than their social lives.\"\n\nThe KBO has good news for sports fans in other countries too.\nThe American sports broadcaster ESPN has reached a deal with Eclat Media Group, which holds the international broadcasting rights to the KBO.\nESPN will air one live game per day and play highlights throughout its programming.\n\n\nThough a single case in the league could bring things to a halt again, the KBO says it plans to hold all 144 games of the season by November, as usual, by canceling the all-star weekend and shortening the post season.\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News\nReporter : tkim@arirang.com",

Paul, the big countdown is finally on\n\nYes, indeed. We are less than 24 hours away from the KBO season finally getting underway and in just a few days the K League season will kick off.\nWe know what the schedules look like as they were released last week, and, in KBO, we also know who the starting pitchers will be too after Sunday's Media Day. Three South Korean pitchers will start the season, the most since 2016.\n\nThat's great. Can you tell us who to look out for, which players have been pinpointed as being important for their respective teams?\n\nSure, due to Social Distancing measures still being in place, Sunday's Media Day took place online for the first time ever.\nDuring which, we learned that there will be 3 homegrown players as starting pitchers, Yang Hyeon-jong of Kia Tigers, who play Kiwoom Heroes, Baek Jung-hyun from Samsung Lions, they play NC Dinos, and Cha Woo-chan of LG Twins.We have not seen this many Korean pitchers start on opening day since 2016 (4), in 2017 all 10 teams sent foreign players out to the mound, and in 2018 it was 9, 2019 8.\n\nWe also heard which foreign players each captain is looking forward to seeing in action. Aaron Brooks of Kia Tigers and Chris Flexen of Doosan Bears were singled out by several captains. Both are former MLB players and set to play in KBO for the first time.\n\nThere are lots of interesting matches taking place tomorrow.\nWhich one will fans be looking forward to the most?\n\nWell, defending Champions Doosan Bears will get their season underway against rivals LG Twins. These two teams share the same stadium and will not want to lose against each other. LG Twins, though, will not have their two American right-handers, Tyler Wilson and Casey Kelly, available which will hinder them. Whereas Doosan won the Korean series last year, LG have not won the Korean series since 1994 and haven't appeared in it since 2002 so will be looking to get off to a good start.\n\nAs well as KBO, K League is back this week.\nWith an international audience set to tune, what can fans look forward to?\n\nIn at least 10 foreign countries, and potentially eight more, fans will be able to tune in to the season opener on Friday, Jeonbuk vs Suwon. These two teams have already played some competitive matches this year in the Champions League but weren't in the best form. Suwon lost both their matches, Jeonbuk managed to earn a draw against Sydney but lost against Yokohama F. Marinos at home so they will be looking to bounce back.\n\nOn Saturday. Last year's runners up, Ulsan Hyundai, who signed Korean international Lee Chung-yong during the winter, start at home to Sangju. Meanwhile, newly promoted Busan IPark are away to Pohang Steelers and Jeju United start life in K League 2 against Seoul E-Land.\n\nBefore you go, Paul, I believe there has been some positive news with the KLPGA?\n\nThat there has, after delays due to COVID-19, the KLPGA Championship will resume later this month and several of the sports top stars look set to take part. Ten-time LPGA winner Kim Se-young * as well as reigning US Women's Open Champion Lee Jeong-eun are planning to take part. Meanwhile, world no. 3 Park Sung-hyun and world no. 13 Kim Hyo-joo have also been rumored to be taking part. According to Yonhap, the tournament will get underway between May 14th and May 17th.\n\nThanks for that roundup, Paul. We will see you again on Friday.\nReporter : paul.neat@hotmail.co.uk",

It's baseball time for all socially distanced, sports-starved fans out there.\nLive in the studio with me sports commentator Daniel Kim to my right and to my left Jeeho Yoo, sports writer at Yonhap News.\nGreat to have you both on the program.\n\nSo, after weeks of no sports to keep us distracted from the coronavirus, the KBO is one of the first leagues to start the 2020 season. I'm sure it's heavenly news for all the baseball fans out there. But, like everything else these days, it can't be the same as pre-COVID-19 days.\nThe games will be played in empty stadiums, but whatelse will be different about this season?\n\nThe empty stadium - I mean, how can talk about Korean baseball without the boisterous fans, the cheers, the chants?. lack of off-days, the players not being able to high-five, the season that will be played into November and post-season beyond that. How do you expect these factors to affect players' performance?\n\nWell, why don't we find out how the teams are gearing up for the big opening day tomorrow.\nJoining us live from South Korea's southeastern city of Busan, home to Lotte Giants is Sungmin Kim.\nHi Sungmin, thanks for linking up with us.\n\nAfter a more than month-long delay, what's the overall atmosphere like out on the field? Are players excited, relieved, worried to be starting the new season in the COVID-19 pandemic?\nWhat about the coaches and managers?\n\n(With the delay of over a month, how is the physical condition of the players? Have they been training during the delay period?\nHas COVID-19 put any restraints on their training?)\n\nThe season is kicking off with no fans in the stands. Lotte Giants is especially known for their fervor cheering. Will the silence in the stadium affect players' performance?\n\nSungmin Kim, Associate at the R&D Department for Lotte Giants, thanks for speaking with us tonight and best of luck to you throughout this season.\n\nThere were reports that ESPN was negotiating a deal to broadcast the games - meaning there could be Korean baseball on TV for American audiences.\nDo we have any updates? I mean, the season starts tomorrow so, if it were to happen, I'm thinking the deal should have been inked by now.\n\nESPN wanted rights to broadcast South Korean professional baseball games for FREE How was this interpreted by KBO?\n\nBaseball stadiums will gradually increase stadium capacity open for fans, but it is inevitable that all KBO teams will take a financial hit - from tickets and merchandise sales.\nHow are the teams taking care of its finances? How are they paying the players, for instance?\n\nA large part of the industry's profits will have to depend on its games being televised.\nWhat measures is KBO having to take to handle its COVID-19 situation?\n\nAgain, this will be another challenge.\nNavigating every single day, surviving every game without any COVID-19 infections will require uncommon vigilance by the players, managers, coaches, by the fans.\nAnd, we know the other leagues around the world will be watching, learning and taking notes to learn, adopt, and adapt from the KBO experience.\nWe'll be looking to you two for our dose of Korean baseball for the next couple of months.\nYoo Jeeho of Yonhap News, Daniel Kim, DKTV - thank you both for a wonderful discussion tonight. We appreciate it.\n\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",

The improving COVID-19 situation in the country means that Korea's professional baseball and football leagues can finally get underway. Our sports editor, Paul Neat, is in the studio again this week. Paul, I am sure this is the news sports fans have been waiting for.\n\nYes, Conn-young, absolutely. One month on from when the baseball season was supposed to start, and two months on from when the football season was due to kick off, we finally have official start dates. KBO will begin on May 5th and the K League football season will start three days later on May 8th.\n\nThe K League season will kick off with the traditional curtain-raiser of the league champions versus the FA Cup winners, so it will be Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors versus Suwon Samsung Bluewings on Friday 8th May, but behind closed doors. The rest of the opening round fixtures will be played on the 9th and 10th, full details of which will be announced.\n\nThis announcement comes after today's K League board meeting, as well as the new start date, what else was discussed?\n\nWell, before the meeting officially got underway, K League President Kwon Oh-gab said that he wants football to bring people hope during this difficult time. He said that it is inevitable that there will be reduced income from local governments, ticket revenue, advertisers, and broadcasters but will overcome this together. He wants K League to become an example for other leagues around the world in terms of how they dealt with COVID-19.\n\nWhat was said about the schedule and the format?\n\nIt is as we discussed recently, there will be 27 games in K League 1 not 38. The only fixture we know right now is the season opener, the rest will be released soon.\n\nBut, we do know that there has been a change to the promotion and relegation system. The army team, Sangju Sangmu, are set to move to a new city next season and so will be relegated regardless of their league standing. One other team will be automatically relegated. There will be no playoff system, instead two teams from K League 2 will win automatic promotion.\n\nSo that's the logistics of how the season will be played out, but have K League said what will happen if a player or a member of staff contracts COVID-19?\n\nYes, they said that if a player or coaching staff is infected during the season that team will not play for 2 weeks and games will be postponed. If it happens on the day of a game, and there are players, referees, or staff found to have COVID-19 then it will be cancelled.\n\nIncheon United played a friendly match with Suwon FC on Thursday. During this game they tested some new measures. Temperature checks at every gate, mixed zone interviews to be done on the pitch not in a confined space indoors, designated passage for media from outside straight to press box. They even had a special water bottle holder which had each players water bottle labelled so there was no mixups.\n\nWith very few football leagues operating around the world, could this be an opportunity for K League to receive some international attention?\n\nThat's right, it is a golden opportunity. K League will be one of the few leagues in the world operating when it finally kicks off. Football-starved fans have turned to the Belarussian Premier League and the Tajik League for their fix. K League is of a high standard and it has been reported that broadcasters from 10 European counties have shown interest in obtaining broadcast rights for K League.\n\nOkay Paul, thank-you for that. We will see you next week.\nReporter : paul.neat@hotmail.co.uk",

The players quietly concentrated on loosening up for the game.\n\nIt was unclear whether foreign players could return to Korea when the pro baseball season was postponed in March. They returned to the country once the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea calmed down. They completed their two week self-quarantine and are now taking part in the practice matches.\n\nI worked hard to stay fit indoors during the self-quarantine period. I also watched some movies during my free time. But most importantly, I concentrated on staying fit.\n\nMy family was worried but Korea has excellent measures so they didn't worry.

The players waved, instead of cheering with high-fives.

If that happens, we'll see a decrease in matches. We will gradually reduce the number of matches.\n\nSpectators will gradually be allowed\n\nIt is uncertain as to when the stands will be filled with spectators.
