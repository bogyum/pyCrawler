Using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or inertia sensory signals, we can more accurately and quickly work out what's happening inside.\"\n\nThe researchers will keep developing the app and discuss it with health authorities for possible future widespread use in this age of COVID-19.\nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.\n\nReporter : peterwjchoi@gmail.com",
