I wanted to come here with my kid as the hiking course is not that tough either.\"\n\nThe volcanic activities have also created this estuary, where fresh water meets with the ocean.\nThe tide's ebb and flow can even be seen in this lake.\nAnd in the afternoon, the water level goes down by up to 2 meters.\n\n\"Tourists can also take a ride on one of Jeju's traditional fishing boats, known as Taewoo. The wooden boats were once used by haenyo, or the island's iconic female divers.\"\nAnd people can use kayaks to get up close to the volcanic cliffs.\n\nBut Manjanggul cave may offer a truly exceptional experience, taking you into the actual passageways that lava once flowed through.\nMeaning \"very deep\" in local dialogue, the tunnel shows the delicate footprints of the lava flow, from which its direction and thickness can be estimated.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been to other caves before but I\u2019ve never seen one this big.\"\n\nSome 170 volcanic caves have been discovered so far, of which four are open to the public.\n\nLee Kyung-eun, Arirang News, Jeju.\nReporter : kelee@arirang.com",
