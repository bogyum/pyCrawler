In these areas, temperatures are projected to exceed 33 degrees Celsius. So make sure to stay hydrated.\n\nThe daytime UV ray index will increase to very high levels all across the nation, so make sure to wear plenty of sunblock.\n\nWith high levels of humidity, rising temperatures during the day will make the atmosphere unstable and cause rain showers. Rain is back in forecast starting on Jeju Island and in southern parts of the nation tomorrow. By Saturday, rain will have spread nationwide.\n\nFor tomorrow, Seoul, Gwangju and Busan will begin the day at 21 degrees Celsius.\n\nIn the daytime, highs will hover around 30 degrees for most areas. Busan and Jeju will be a bit cooler at 26 degrees.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Tokyo will see highs of 31 degrees with some sporadic rain during the daytime.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",
