The last one back in March when the pandemic was really picking up steam. Tell us more about this decision.\n\nThe BOK also said it now expects the Korean economy to contract this year by two tenths of a percent. It's the first time it's said that since 2009. Also, it's the first such projection from a major public sector entity in Korea.\n\nAs we often discuss here, there are concerns about the Korean government's fiscal soundness going forward if it goes ahead with a third big extra budget for this year, and it is planning to do so. What do you make of that?\n\nIt's shaping up to be a good week on Wall Street. Despite the tensions with China, all three main indexes up on Wednesday, the Dow breaking through 25-thousand for the first time since early March and the S&P back up to 3-thousand.
