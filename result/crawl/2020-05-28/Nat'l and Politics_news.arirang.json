Uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is one of the main examples. Big Data is our weapon in preparing for an uncertain future.\"\n\nSpeaking at the '2020 South Korea Future Forecast Symposium', the Prime Minister vowed that the government will implement a Korean version of the 'Digital New Deal', and strive to nurture new technologies like Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, blockchains and bio-medicine.\nAlso at the symposium, one economic expert forecasts that globalization is regressing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and said this will lead to the end of the dominance of the U.S.\n\n\"The main change in the post-COVID-19 era will be \"de-globalization\". There will be changes in the global value chain. Digitalization and non-contact life will expand, and the weakened dominance of the U.S. will open up the G0 era.\"\n\nThere was also a special session focused on the pandemic.\nOne expert from the International Vaccine Institute stressed the need to use data to pull forward the lagging COVID-19 vaccine development in South Korea.\n\n\"Unlike diagnosis and quarantine, South Korea is far behind in vaccine development. But I believe there are still plenty of opportunities. We can use data that's already out to come up with a better strategy.\"\n\nHe added that at least 10 institutions and companies in South Korea are working on developing a vaccine, and he believes around two of them will start clinical trials in June.\nHe said he predicts vaccines to be available by early next year.\n\n\"Thursday's event was also broadcast live online,\u2026 as part of social distancing efforts amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\nKim Jae-hee, Arirang News.\"\nReporter : jhee@arirang.com",

Tell us about that.\n\nThis cluster infection comes as South Korea reopens its schools, which is causing concern, so the government has taken stronger quarantine measures.\n\nIt announced that public facilities like parks and museums will be closed for two weeks starting this Friday in Seoul, Incheon and the surrounding province of Gyeonggi-do.\nAlso, entertainment facilities, like bars and clubs, are advised to close until June 14th, and social distancing measures will be strengthened if the situation isn't brought under control in the next two weeks.\n\n\"In order to stop the virus from spreading in the metropolitan area, it's very important how we handle the next two weeks. If the outbreak continues to grow, we'll have no choice but to go back to strong social distancing.\"\n\nThe Gyeonggi-do provincial office has ordered a two-week shutdown of Coupang's logistics centers in Bucheon and Goyang, where an additional case was confirmed.\nThis the first time Gyeonggi-do has banned gatherings at private facilities.\nBack to you, Conn-young.\n\nOur Choi Jeong-yoon live from one of the now-shuttered warehouses in Bucheon.

            "context": "South Korea has been touted as one of the first countries in the world to bring a major COVID-19 outbreak under control although we saw another peak in cases due to cluster outbreaks in and around the capital.\nThe country has controlled COVID-19 by rapidly scaling up testing as well as relying on other high-tech solutions: A government app tracks the location of all new visitors to the country; people who violate quarantine have to wear a location-tracking bracelet; \"smart city\" tech is being deployed to bolster contact tracing networks.\nSo, what is contact tracing and how does it work? What legal framework is there in South Korea that enables such aggressive tracing adn aren't there privacy concerns?\nIt's the topic of our News In-Depth tonight with Ko Hak-soo, Professor at Seoul National University School of Law.\n\nAs South Korea deals with what may be a second wave of COVID-19 outbreak with cluster infections linked to e-commerce warehouses and nightclubs in the Itaewon district, active testing and contact tracing are again coming under the spotlight.\nBut, Professor Ko, contact tracing isn't a new technique at all in fact, although it's only been brought to the public attention now, the technique has been used by health departments for decades.\nCan you tell us the principles of this technology?\n\nFrom Singapore's 'TraceTogether' to Australia's 'COVIDSafe', contact tracing companies have been emerging. What would be South Korea's equivalent?\n\nAre these companies forming for the purpose of combating COVID-19, using what's already been used by health departments? Are they government-supervised companies, or a private corporation?\n\nRecently the first Google/Apple-based contact-tracing app was launched in Switzerland.\nAs the world's two biggest mobile operating systems, they both have privacy restrictions on using users' information, including location data.\nFirst, what is the new technology incorporated by the cooperation of Apple and Google?\n\nHow does this compare to what's been used in Korea?\n\nWhere do humans come into this process? I hear contact tracers and epidemiological surveillance officers play a vital role in the traicing process.\n\nProtection of private information has been a highlighted issue with contact tracing.\nContributing to South Korea's success was its \"centralized system\" of information transmission, whereas the U.S. and Europe have been opting for a \"decentralized system.\"\nWhat exactly is the difference between the two systems on how data is shared?\n\nWhich is more efficient, or perhaps necessary at times of a global pandemic?\n\nBefore launching apps on the mobile app store platform, developers need to be granted permission. This is the step where among other things, privacy terms are reviewed.\nWhere exactly can the line be drawn in terms of privacy protection laws?\n\nAfter the most recent Itaewon cluster infection, certain establishments have enforced a QR code verification system upon entry. Where does this tie in to everything?\n\nNaver and KakaoTalk have joined in on supporting the QR code identity verification services at entrances of high-risk institutions.\nThere is still very high levels of concern over risks of exposure or leaks of personal information.\nNot to get too technical, but is it possible for necessary information to be collected by the Center for Disease Control without extended private information being uncovered?\n\nWhat is it that people really should be worried about?\n\nKo Hak-soo, Professor at Seoul National University School of Law, many thanks as always for your insights this evening. We appreciate it.\n\n\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",
