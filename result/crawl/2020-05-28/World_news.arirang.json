The government is closely monitoring the situation.\"\n\n\"We discussed recent issues surrounding the U.S.-China conflict. Our focus is on how to minimize the negative impact on our economy and companies.\"\n\nThe officials say that the Hong Kong national security law was not dealt with explicitly at the meeting.\nHowever, as Washington and Beijing both continue trying to gain the support of South Korea, U.S.-China relations remain a critical diplomatic agenda for Seoul.\nOh Jung-hee, Arirang News.\nReporter : jhlucyoh@arirang.com",
