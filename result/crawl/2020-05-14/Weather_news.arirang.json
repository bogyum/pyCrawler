But things will cool off tomorrow with some rain. Tell us more, Seungmin.\n\nSure, Conn-young. The temporary heat we had today will ease when the rain comes tomorrrow nationwide. It'll start at dawn in Jeju and slowly expand towards the east. Rain in most areas will last until Saturday morning, but it'll be heavy especially in the southern parts of the country.\n\nThe southern coast and Jeju can expect 120mm of rain. Elsewhere in the southern regions we'll see up to 80mm, and in the central regions, including Seoul, about 5 to 40mm are expected.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, rain clouds will be looming again, and another bout of rain across the country is in store for us next Monday and Tuesday.\n\nTomorrow, we'll start off in the mid-to-upper teens, with Seoul at 16 degrees and Gwangju and Daegu at 17.\n\nCool spells are expected for the daytime as the highs reach only 18 degrees in Seoul and Busan.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Tokyo and Beijing will have cloudy spells.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",

With the ultrafine dust and yellow dust coming in from overseas, air quality across the nation is not looking so great. Many of you might be wondering about the difference between the two.
