We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and employment and, already, the job gains of the last decade have been erased.\"\n\nPowell added the overall policy response has provided a touch of relief and will support the recovery, but longer term concerns remain as there could be \"lasting damage\" to the U.S. economy.\n\n\"A prolonged recession and weak recovery could also discourage business investment and expansion, further limiting the resurgence of jobs as well as the growth of the capital stock and the pace of technological advancement.\"\n\nU.S. stocks fell immediately following Powell's gloomy outlook.\nThe Dow Jones shed over 500-points to end at 23,247, while the S&P 500 retraced 1.8 percent.\nThe NASDAQ closed 1.5 percent lower at 8,863.\n\nAccording to a survey by the Wall Street Journal, economists believe the U.S. will post economic growth of minus-32-percent in the second quarter, a much larger drop than the roughly minus-5-percent recorded in the first quarter.\nBut they also believe the American economy will start recovering in the latter half of the year, ultimately recording minus-6.6-percent GDP growth for the whole of 2020.\nOh Jung-hee, Arirang News.\nReporter : jhlucyoh@arirang.com",

Recently, there has been much debate over whether the COVID-19 pandemic will end globalization as we know it. I'd like to know your view on this. Do you see divisions between countries worsening over the course of the pandemic?\n\nAre politicians and government leaders taking advantage of the COVID-19 situation and using it as a pretext to deepen existing rivalries and division?\n\nIn the past, the rise of nationalism led to the two world wars. If the current trend of anti-globalism sentiment and populist tendencies continues to intensify, what do you think will be the outcome?\n\nThe strength of global institutions has also been shaken. The WHO has been widely criticized for its lack of capacity to respond to the coronavirus and for its close links to China. And for the last few years, the World Trade Organisation's rules have been increasingly flouted by member nations. Why have international organisations failed? Are they relevant in this day and age or are they simply dinosaurs of a time gone perfectly highlighting the death of globalization?\n\nYou warned 15 years ago that we should have moved onto ideas of social and economic wellbeing that are not dependent on permanently growing trade and consumption. The world hasn't taken heed. What dangers do we face, if we repeat past mistakes and simply try to rebuild what we had?\n\nShould there be a new version of globalization that attempts to overcome the shortcomings of the previous order if you will\n\nHow can countries come together to beat this virus and build a better, more sustainable future? Will this take U.S. leadership, or do you see a multipolar world order where nations or blocs of different states balance out their interests?\n\nHow do you see the world order being reshaped by tech giants, as their presence continues to encroach on our lives and censor our opinions. Will they govern us and who will govern them?\n\nWell, it's been an absolute pleasure speaking with you Mr. John Ralston Saul. Thank you for joining us from Toronto.\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",
