Emergency employment measures are urgently needed.\"\n\nThe government expects some 765-thousand new jobs to be created.\nIt will resume the hiring process for some 48-thousand public officials and jobs in public institutions this month.\nYoung people directly hit by the pandemic will also have more opportunities through plans to create more than 550-thousand additional jobs in non-contact and digital sectors.\nIn the budget for this year, the government had planned to create 945-thousand jobs, and some 167-thousand of those will be added in May and June.\nOfficials plan to finalize the specific measures during next week's economic meeting, and draw up the required funds from a planned third coronavirus-related supplementary budget.\nBut an expert says more needs to be done to encourage hiring by private businesses.\n\n\"It's good that the government is drawing funds to create more jobs in the public sector. But it's more important to let private firms lead the economy, rather than the government taking the lead. The government could take extra measures, like reducing corporate taxes, leading companies to hire more and invest more.\"\n\n\"Both the public and private sectors will have to create jobs to overcome this employment crisis, but the government's measure can be seen as a positive step toward tackling the most torrid period that jobseekers have seen in years.\nKim Jae-hee, Arirang News.\"\nReporter : jhee@arirang.com",

But with gas prices having dropped drastically amid the current pandemic, do you think the shift will be delayed? How do you think this affects the domestic vehicle purchasing habit?\n\nGenerally, it's common to think that battery operated, or even hybrid cars, have less power and are more expensive.\nSometimes, it's difficult to find charging stations, and even cases of weather affecting the batteries. Is this something of the past?\nWhy are you such a strong advocate of EVs? What are the advantages of EVs over engine vehicles?\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in has been pushing for the Korean version of a New Deal not only create jobs but for Korea to lead the global digital economy. Earlier this week, he added a 'Green New Deal' to that.\nHow does the joining of Samsung and Hyundai to manufature EVs play into this plan?\n\nSamsung Group has a car manufacturing line of their own. Why haven't they set out to produce EVs of their own? Why are they collaborating with Hyundai and supplying batteries?\n\nDo you see South Korea becoming a stronger global BEV battery supplier or the next Tesla?\n\nWe saw in the past how a strong and demanding domestic market made Korea a world leader in ICE automobiles, flat screen TVs, refrigerators and air conditioning, and mobile phones and the high-technology components needed to support them.\nWhat kind of support do we need in order to see similar results in new BEVs?\n\nJames P.
