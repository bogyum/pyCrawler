In March, there was a 90 percent drop and in April, it was a 99 percent drop on year. This means that no one is coming or going.\"\n\nBut, people are traveling within the country.\nAn official from the online accommodation booking platform, 'Yanolja', said that during the last holiday, whilst the number of people traveling abroad plunged by 90 percent, the number of those traveling within the country rose by 49 percent.\n\n\"The independent travel industry is already big in Korea. People can rent cars and find their own way around using the Internet.\"\n\nFor now, the best option for travelers is to do so within the country. And then, when it's safe and people can travel abroad again, the tourism industry will bounce back.\nJang Tae-hyun, Arirang News\nReporter : tommyjang@arirang.com",

We hope that the two can solve the export issues and move forward together.\"\n\nSouth Korea's trade ministry on Tuesday highlighted its efforts to bolster its export systems and ease Japan's distrust over Seoul's system.\nIn fact, South Korea revised its trade laws in March to clarify its control over conventional weapons exports on top of increasing the number of staff for export control programs.\nThe new laws are set to go into effect on June 19.\nThe almost year-long trade row dates back to last July when Japan imposed export restrictions on three key industrial materials critical for Seoul's chip and display industries.\nIncluded were photoresist, etching gas and fluorinated polyimide.\nTokyo's move came after a South Korean Supreme Court in 2018 ordered Japanese companies to compensate Korean victims for wartime forced labor during Japan's colonial rule.\nJapan also removed Seoul from its list of trusted partners, arguing that South Korea failed to effectively control the trade of sensitive materials that could be utilized for military use.\nSince then, South Korea dropped its World Trade Organization lawsuit against Japan in November and Tokyo partially eased the photoresist export curbs in December.\nThe two neighboring countries did hold 16-hour long talks back in March but saw no significant progress.\nKim Dami, Arirang News.\nReporter : damikim@arirang.com",

The economic fallout from the coronavirus is unlike anything we have ever experienced, having put millions of people around the world out of work.\nOver the weekend, we heard the coronavirus has put at least 33 million Americans out of work, 20.2 million jobs were lost in April alone.\nBut many are expecting this is only the beginning of a long and grueling job crisis.\nTo talk about what to expect and how the job market will change over the course of the pandemic, we have joining us today: Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific Chief Economist at S&P Global Ratings and Kim Byung-joo, a Professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.\n\nDr. Roache: The unemployment rate in the U.S. has soared to 14.7% but some are expecting it to go as high as 20%. But the fundamental concern is when, or even whether, these mostly service sector jobs are coming back. What's your view?\n\nDr. Kim: It took over a decade for U.S. employment to recover from the 2008 global financial crisis. Do you think this pandemic will also be followed by a long recovery process and what does this mean for first-time job seekers especially young people?\n\nDr. Roache: Why will this job crisis be particularly devastating for the Asia Pacific region? Which countries will be the hardest hit and how should governments protect those who are disproportionately hit?\n\nDr. Kim: Compared to the millions of layoffs we're seeing in the U.S., countries like Germany are initiating flexible working conditions, while the U.K. government is subsidizing up to 80% of wages. Which approach do you think is needed in this pandemic to stabilize people's livelihoods and somewhat secure their prospects of finding work?\n\nDr. Roache: For those who get their jobs back, will it be under the same terms and conditions? (Or will there be shorter working hours and different terms of employment?)\n\nDr. Kim: Which jobs or skillsets should people prepare for in the post-COVID job market?\n\nThat's all we have time for today.
