With the ultrafine dust and yellow dust coming in from overseas, air quality across the nation is not looking so great. Many of you might be wondering about the difference between the two. Well, as the name suggests, ultrafine dust are composed of smaller particles, so it can penetrate more deeply into our respiratory system.\n\nAnd that being said, fine dust concentrations across the northern region are forecast to remain at \"bad\" levels until tomorrow, while southern regions such as Gwangju and Busan will temporarily rise to \"very bad,\" so please be aware.\n\nWe had some pretty cool spells today but temperatures will rise back up tomorrow. On Thursday, the mercury will reach up to 25 degrees, which is the average for early summer. On Friday and Saturday, rain is in forecast nationwide.\n\nWe'll start off with sunny skies tomorrow, with Seoul and Gwangju at 10 degrees and Daegu 11.\n\nDaytime highs in Seoul will reach 21 degrees, Gwangju 23 and Daegu 26.\n\nFor Korea's neighbors, Tokyo and Beijing will have sunny spells.\n\nI'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.\nReporter : xtinalee93@gmail.com",

Due to the steady influx of dust particles from overseas, fine dust concentration levels are sky-rocketing. Those levels are standing at 'very bad' in the Seoul metropolitan area and so an advisory has been issued in the capital and in Gangwon-do Province. Level 'bad' is being observed in parts of Chungcheong-do Province and other parts of Gangwon-do Province. So for those planning to head out, please make sure to wear a mask.\n\nRain is in forecast starting from late tonight in some central regions, as well as in parts of Jeollabuk-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do provinces. The amount of rain will be less than 5 millimeters.\n\nCentral parts of the nation will have cooler spells tomorrow, while southern regions will be mild. Seoul will be 12 degrees Celsius and Busan 16.\n\nDaytime temperatures will be 1 to 4 degrees lower than today's.
