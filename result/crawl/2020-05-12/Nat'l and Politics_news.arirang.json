The pre-existing EBS Software Learning Platform could only be used by two thousand students at a time, so there were 15-hundred times as many students as usual in less than a month. It was unprecedented.\"\n\n\"To make the unprecedented number of online classes possible, Microsoft and several domestic IT companies such as Bespin Global joined together and shared confidential information.\"\n\nMicrosoft provided the Cloud service which is the foundation on which Bespin Global created the infrastructure. Although it was considered impossible at first, engineers say they tried their best because they felt a responsibility to help students start their delayed semester.\n\n\"Usually we provide services for a specific company, but this time it was for all the students in South Korea. We had this sense of duty that we need to let them attend classes and get back to normal school life even though it's online.\"\n\nThe experts put their heads together to find solutions to their impossible challenge.\n\n\"We even had a war room where all the companies and education ministry officials worked together. We would share information to solve errors rather than blaming each other.\"\n\nThis cooperation and teamwork made online classes possible in South Korea.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",
