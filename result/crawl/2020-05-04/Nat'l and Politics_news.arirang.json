From April 20th, it adopted relatively loosened social distancing measures. And from May 6th, it'll shift to a more relaxed stance of \"distancing in daily life\".\n\n\"Distancing in daily life allows people to do social and economic activities, and at the same time, means being responsible ourselves for stopping the virus from spreading. We must create a new daily routine that can prevent the spread of the virus.\"\n\nHe also stressed that the shift does not mean the end of the outbreak, and said the country will return to tougher social distancing measures if the situation worsens.\nThe guidelines include five basic rules that individuals are asked to follow.\nPeople are to stay at arms' length from others in public spaces.\nThey should also wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 30 seconds and use their sleeves to cover their mouths when coughing.\nIndoor spaces should be ventilated at least twice a day, and staying psychologically close to family and friends despite social distancing is important.\nWorkers are also advised to stay home for 3 to 4 days when feeling sick.\nThe government will apply this last guideline to the public sector first, while coming up with new measures to make it more practical for the private sector.\nOn a community level, a certain person should be designated to be responsible for prevention measures, and the rest of the group should be fully cooperative.\nDaily body temperature screenings should also be used to keep communities safe.\nAbove all, quarantine authorities say that cooperation is the key.\n\n\"Under the loosened guidelines, South Korea will also gradually reopen schools and public facilities in phases, and allow gatherings and events to take place.\nKim Jae-hee, Arirang News.\"\nReporter : jhee@arirang.com",
