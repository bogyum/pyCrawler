Finance is a direct tool used to carry out national policies. It must be used to address the people's burdens in light of the economic crisis.\n\nMoon also called for the swift drawing up of a third extra budget with the aim of having it passed by June, emphasizing the importance of timely fiscal measures.\nAs for concerns over the country's fiscal soundness, Moon said there needs to be enough fiscal spending to overcome the crisis and strengthen the country's economic fundamentals.\nWith two supplementary budgets passed already, the country's debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 41 percent lower than the OECD average of 110 percent.\n\nThrough sufficient fiscal injection, we must overcome this serious crisis swiftly and boost the country's economic growth rate to secure its fiscal health, from a long-term perspective. This is the way to prevent the worsening of the debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nThe president added that the government will also be tightening its belt and restructuring its budget to cut unnecessary spending.\nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.\nReporter : kimmj@arirang.com",
