I believe the series could be popular with two directors' own strengths brewed together.\"\n\nThe series has already attracted much attention from the global press.\nThe BBC has praised the series, saying viewers should look no further than this drama to quench their craving for content that tackles issues we are currently facing.\n\n\"The reason why Bong's work is attracting lots of fans is because it deals with the issue of 'class'. Snowpiercer shows how people are worried about dropping down from their current class. It also gives us a warning that conflict between classes and even system destruction could happen if we don't take care of such issues.\"\n\nThe TV series can also go into more depth and offer a more detailed plot that the movie couldn't provide due to the lack of time.\nThe first two episodes are already available on Netflix, and a new episode will be released every week.\nKIM Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.\n\nReporter : reina5467@gmail.com",

Great to see you back.\n\n\n\nIt isn't just cinemas and studios that have suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year.\nFilm festivals and film events have also been greatly impacted.\nHowever, one of Korea\u2019s biggest events, the Jeonju International Film\nFestival, is going to take place from May 28. What kind of an event will it be this year?\n\n-Honestly, it\u2019s not entirely clear at this point. Cinema screenings in Jeonju will be limited to jury\nmembers and competition members, with no public audience.\n\n-But online screenings of some kind will take place\n-Festival will last from next Thursday until September 20. Plan within that is not yet clear.\n\nWhat does that mean for festivals later in the year?\n-Will depend on Covid situation going forward, and how cinemas fare in the coming months\n-Foreign guests will be unlikely for most if not all of the year for various reasons\n-Online showcases may be common during summer, though that poses copyright issues\n\nAnd how has this situation affected other film-related events, such as awards?\n\n-Many cancellations and postponements\n-Starting to come back online\n-BaekSang Arts Awards announced nominees and will have ceremony without live audience\n-Wildflower Film Awards will be first major film event this Friday May 22. With small audience of\nfilm professionals\n\nKorea's dominant news cycle these past two weeks has been the recent Itaewon Covid-19 cluster, which sparked fears of a second wave of infections. How did the local film industry react to the news?\n\n-INTRUDER delayed from May 21 to June 4\n-Other releases delayed (A FRENCH WOMAN, INNOCENCE)\n\nWill the release of Intruder be a big test for local cinemas, to see if audiences are ready to come\nback?\n\n-Yes, other studios will probably take note and schedule their own films accordingly\n-Other films are already starting to fill up the June calendar (SORIKKUN, #ALIVE - Lotte, first of the\nmajors to date a title)\n\nBeyond distributors beginning to release major films again, what are the cinemas doing to woo\nback their viewers?\n\n-Some theatres closed, but have opened back again\n-They\u2019ve been enforcing 50% seating for a while (not that that makes much of a difference with the\nlow numbers\n-But honestly not much. In my opinion exhibitors generally have a stranglehold on the film business\naround the world. They take none of the risk, yet rely on companies taking massive gambles with\nexpensive productions. Same thing here, it\u2019s not clear what they\u2019re doing to woo audiences back to\ntheatres.\n\nWhat could the summer season, usually the busiest time for moviegoing in Korea, look like this\nyear?\n-Depends on INTRUDER and summer releases\n-Potentially, PENINSULA, HERO, SPACE SWEEPERS, MOGADISHU\n-If cinemas reach 70% capacity, local films will dominated due to lack of Hollywood competition\n\nIf the number of daily infections stays down this time, do you think audiences will be ready to\nreturn?\n\n-Hard to say, but the switch may happen very quickly.\n-Speed of Itaewon cluster resolution will increase confidence in government\u2019s ability to contain a\nspread\n-A major title will help\n-Once modest audiences turn out, provided situation continues to improve, major audiences will\nlikely return very quickly, in a few weeks, if not days\n\nWhen was the last time you went to a cinema? Are you eager to get back?\n\n-Late February for THE INVISIBLE WOMAN.\n-Honestly I\u2019m very happy to watch films at home\n-But, once it feels safe to do so I can\u2019t wait to put my arms around a bucket of stale popcorn and\nlose myself once more to the silver screen.\n\nLooking globally, will the film industry experience big changes whenever business does come\nback online?\n\n-Significant changes\n-First, when can theaters open? When will big films open?\n-How can productions start again? Safety? Insurance premiums?\n-Will major exhibitors survive?\n-If not, what happens? (possibly bought by streamers)\n\nAs the world cautiously begin to reopen for business and we here in Korea begin distancing in daily lives, I sure hope the day will soon come when we can safely and regularly drop by the theaters to enjoy our movie nights with a bucket of popcorn in our arms.\nThank you, as always, Pierce.\nReporter : jenmoon@arirang.co.kr",
