With Korea moving to get rid of the old system of 'public certificates' for those kinds of services, non-contact biometric identification, which is safer and more convenient, is expected to keep growing amid COVID-19.\"\n\nThe Korea Information Security Industry Association forecasts the domestic market for facial recognition systems to grow to around 1-hundred-21-million dollars this year.\nAnd because mask-wearing has become the new norm since the virus outbreak, the industry is adapting to that too.\nSome of the newer biometric systems can identify a person even with their mask on, and some are designed to verify only people wearing masks.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News.\nReporter : smkim@arirang.com",
