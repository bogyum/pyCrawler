If they do, I can't see Hong Kong remaining in an Asian financial center the way it has been for many, many years.\"\n\nO'Brien added that the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act and the 2019 Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, both require the U.S. Secretary of State to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy, but that would be difficult if the law is passed.\n\n\"Especially if the law is passed, it's hard to see how Secretary Pompeo could make that certification. If he fails to make that certification, there are consequences that come with it. Sanctions and others.\"\n\nThe new national security law which China plans to impose on Hong Kong will allow Beijing to implement laws that prevent and punish subversion, terrorism, separatism as well as any foreign interference.\nBeijing explains that it's to (quote)\"safeguard national security\" in Hong Kong and improve the institutional framework of \"one country, two systems.\"\nThe law has been criticized by pro-democracy activists and the international community due to the risk of eroding freedom in Hong Kong. But China has claimed that the matter is purely domestic and no foreign country has the right to interfere.\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam expressed support to Beijing's plan and vowed that the Hong Kong government will \"fully cooperate\" if the law is passed.\nOh Jung-hee, Arirang News.\nReporter : jhlucyoh@arirang.com",

Over the weekend, all eyes were on China which opened its most important political event of the year on Friday the National People's Congress following a two-month delay due to the COVID-19 outbreak. To the surprise of many observers, it did not announce its annual economic growth rate, an unprecedented move for Beijing since it started revealing its projections in 1990.\nWhat China did reveal, though, was its plans to push through with a controversial bill on Hong Kong that observers fear would effectively end the city's autonomy.\nTo discuss these developments, we have joining us today Jack Gao, Program Economist at the Institute for New Economic Thinking and Joseph Bosco former China country director in the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nMr. Gao: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China would not set an economic growth target for 2020. Why do you think it decided to skip the projection and is it a risky move?\n\nDr. Bosco: What does this decision tell you about China's state of affairs?\n\nMr. Gao: What's the biggest challenge for the Chinese economy right now amid the COVID-19 pandemic? What will it have to overcome to achieve the 9 million jobs it pledged to create as part of its 500 billion dollar stimulus plan?\n\nMr. Gao: The Chinese economy shrank nearly 7 percent in the first quarter, after decades of constant growth. Will its stimulus plan work?\n\nDr. Bosco: Also at the meeting, China said it plans to pass \"national security\" legislation that would ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion in Hong Kong. It has been an extremely controversial issue. So why push through with this now?\n\nDr. Bosco: White House security advisor Robert O Brien said on Sunday the U.S. government will likely impose sanctions on China if Beijing implements the law, while Beijing's foreign minister Wang Yi warned against foreign intervention. Will tensions escalate even more and to what extent?\n\nMr. Gao: The U.S.-China trade war seems to be back on and relations have soured significantly over the last few weeks, with Trump administration officials vowing to make China pay for the pandemic. On top of that, China seems to be waging a trade war with Australia as well. How will these disputes affect China's recovery if they continue?\n\nDr. Bosco: Is it wise for China to be making economic enemies at this time? Also, with China's narrative of its fight will potentially drive away Beijing's partners?\n\nThat's where we'll have to wrap up the discussion but it's been wonderful speaking with you. Jack Gao, Program Economist at the Institute for New Economic Thinking and Joseph Bosco, Joseph Bosco former China country director in the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense thank you for joining the program.\n\n\nReporter : osy@arirang.com",
